0,Is  Disability  Insurance  Required  By  Law?,"Not generally. There are five states that require most all employers carry short term disability insurance on their employees. These states are: California, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island. Besides this mandatory short term disability law, there is no other legislative imperative for someone to purchase or be covered by disability insurance."
1,Can  Creditors  Take  Life  Insurance  After  Death?,"If the person who passed away was the one with the debt, creditors generally cannot take the life insurance proceeds left as long as the beneficiary was a person. The money then belongs to that beneficiary, and as long as creditors do not have a claim against the beneficiary, they cannot take life insurance proceeds from them."
2,Does  Travelers  Insurance  Have  Renters  Insurance?,"One of the insurance carriers I represent is Travelers and yes, you can purchase Renters insurance through Travelers. I would look for a local agent who can assist you in placing a renters policy if you are interested. I am sure the local agent would be happy to quote Travelers if they have access and other carries as well."
3,Can  I  Drive  A  New  Car  Home  Without  Insurance?,"Most auto dealers will not let you drive the car off of the lot unless you have proof of insurance if there is a loan on the car. It is never a good idea to drive a car without insurance. If you traded a car in, then the coverage on the older car may extend to the new car temporarily, but you need to call your agent as soon as possible and get it changed. Most dealerships have an insurance agent they work with who can get you coverage as well."
4,Is  The  Cash  Surrender  Value  Of  Life  Insurance  Taxable?,"Cash surrender value comes only with Whole Life Insurance, never with Term. It is the amount you can terminate your policy and receive. That amount includes both what you put in and what profit you made. The profit is taxable, just as most profit would be taxable. A far better idea would be NOT to surrender your Whole Life Policy, but instead to keep it and borrow against it and either then not repay it or choose to repay it as you wish. You continue to grow in value, even when the loan is out, and your policy stays in force, although the death benefit is reduced by the loan until it is paid back. There are numerous option you should discuss with a qualified agent. Gary Lane, Registered Representative, New York Life, 949 797 2424. Call anytime. Thank you."
5,How  Is  Annuity  Income  Reported?,"The good news is that annuity income is usually reported by the insurance company issuing the annuity. When they make a disbursement they also issue appropriate documentation to assist in filing your taxes. They send identical information to the Internal Revenue Service. Generally speaking when money is withdrawn from an annuity it is treated as interest and then taxed as ordinary income until the interest is exhausted and only the basis (the sum of premiums paid) remains. That money can be recovered free of income tax. If the annuity is annuitized, that is paid out in monthly installments either over an extended period of time or the lifetime of the annuitant, then an exclusion factor is determined and applied to each payment. A part of each payment will be taxed as ordinary income. The bad news is that these principles apply to non-qualified annuities held by individuals and these barely touch all the situations that can arise and the taxation of those unique situations. While this response is not meant to take the place of legal and accounting professional advice it should alert you to some of the complexities of taxing annuities. The most obvious situation is when an annuity is held as an asset of qualified pension plan. This includes defined benefit plans; defined contribution plans (401(k), IRAs and many others. The income taken by these plans is taxed as ordinary income unless it is taken prior to age fifty-nine and a half. If taken earlier it could be subject to a penalty tax of an additional ten per cent. Where annuities taxation becomes complex is when deferred annuities are transferred. That is when a person gives another person an annuity on their life, or the life of a third party. The basic rule is that the transfer is treated as surrender and taxed accordingly. The annuity that is transferred is treated as having been fully paid. It then has a basis of the value that was taxed. For estate planning reasons the ownership of an annuity is sometimes held by a trust and this leads to another set of taxation considerations involving the non-natural person rule. Who is going to be taxed is the basic issue and this can be quite tangled. Of course there are exceptions to all of these rules. Taxation is fairly straightforward if the annuity is annuitized. State laws concerning probate can create some unexpected outcomes and taxation. When an individual owns an annuity and the annuitant is another person, perhaps a spouse, the death of the owner triggers the beneficiary provision and another third person could suddenly own the contract upsetting the intentions of the couple, even if it is a child. Many of the taxation rules are specific to individual insurance companies and it is wise to carefully make sure that the company you select from whom to purchase the annuity follows the procedures that will maintain your plan and keep taxation as uncomplicated as possible. Absent all other plans, the IRS frequently calls for a liquidation of a transferred annuity within five years. The key is the desire to get the tax question settled."
6,What  Does  AAA  Home  Insurance  Cover?,"AAA Home insurance, like all other major carriers, covers a wide variety of claims, including fire, theft, vandalism, and many other items. However, there are numerous types of policies offered, so it is best to determine the type of policy you have to accurately understand all of the benefits. An experienced broker can help."
7,What  Is  A  Simple  Retirement  Plan?,"what is a SIMPLE retirement plan? A Simple is an inexpensive opportunity for a small business to have a retirement plan that doesn't break the bank in advisor fees. A Simple plan is an IRS approved plan with only a few steps to follow so expensive testing and record keeping aren't necessary. For any small business who are considering a retirement plan to offer, this should be right on top as it does provide a great platform for a business who would rather use it's money to put towards employees retirements rather than third party administers plans."
8,What  Does  Social  Security  Disability  Insurance  Cover?,Social Security Disability Insurance pays a monthly benefit to people who cannot work due to a disability. The benefit is paid in cash to the recipient to use as they wish; it is not paid to an institution or entity. An injury or illness that causes the person to be unable to work is covered.
9,Is  Car  Insurance  Prepaid?,"Yes, automobile insurance is typically paid in advance. Normally no less than thirty days at a time. Each carrier sets their own requirements as to the initial payment amount for new coverage. Most carriers allow clients to pay monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. If you pay your premium in full for semi-annual or annual you may also receive a discount on your rate ( this is solely at the discretion of the carrier )."
10,What  Does  Medicare  Part  B  Cover?,"Medicare Part B covers the doctor services, outpatient hospital services, medical services and supplies. There is a monthly cost charged to the Social Security check received. There is a deductible and 20% copayments if incurred. In addition you pay all costs for services and supplies not covered by Medicare."
11,Can  Veterans  Get  Life  Insurance?,"Unless a service person gets Veterans Group Life Insurance (VGLI) within a year from separating from the service, their Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI) will end and they will need to get a private policy. Contact an agency or website that carries several products to choose from to find the best rate for Veteran's life insurance."
12,Does  My  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Lost  Wedding  Ring?,"Great question. Generally no, your Homeowners' policy will not cover for anything that is lost. This is referred to as ""Mysterious Disappearance"" in your policy documents and is usually listed as a specific exclusion. That having been said, you can certainly obtain coverage for such a loss by working with your insurance professional and asking that the item be insured specifically either as a rider which is attached to your Homeowners' policy or as a stand alone separate policy. You will need to provide a current appraisal and the item would be insured to the stated amount on the appraisal. Such riders or separate policies (commonly referred to as ""Personal Inland Marine"") include much broader coverage than does a standard Homeowners policy and will cover for such a loss."
13,How  Does  Assigned  Risk  Auto  Insurance  Work?,Assigned risk in California which is what I amfamiliarwith is a processing center by which people having trouble buying auto insurance are connected with an insurance company that will insure them. Assigned Risk is not an insurance company but are companies that are required by law to participate. The amount of autos an insurance company has on the road would constitute the percentage of their obligation to the plan. There is financial hardship criteria to qualify for Assigned Risk. Also agents who offer Assigned Risk must becertifiedto offer this coverage. You can go online and then beconnectedto an agent to see if you qualify for assigned risk.
14,Can  My  Boyfriend  Add  Me  To  His  Car  Insurance?,If you are living in the same household then he should put you on the list of drivers. The insurance follows the car and that is linked to a household. The person buying the insurance is in the household and can loan the car to whoever he wishes. The insurance covers the automobile. If you are not living together there wouldnt be anything gained by putting you on the policy.
15,Do  I  Need  A  Police  Report  To  Submit  A  Claim  For  A  Car  Accident  On  Private  Property?,"Actually, though the local police might prepare an accident report for you, in many cases, because the incident occured on private property, it is more likely that they would take no action at all. Therefore, if it is possible, it becomes more important to exchange information with the other party involved. I would also recommend that neither car be moved and that you take photos for your records and that of your Insurance Company to help in the processing of the claim."
16,Does  Full  Coverage  Auto  Insurance  Cover  Repairs?,"By ""Full Coverage"" I am assuming you mean, does carrying Comprehensive and Collision coverage cover repairs? If you have a covered claim i.e. -an accident, hit a deer, backed into your wife's car like I did the other week - then yes, carrying Comprehensive and Collision coverage would pay to fix those covered damages subject to your poilcy deductible. If you are experiencing general vehicle issues, i.e. - motor running roof, transmission mission or other general wear and tear - no, your insurance coverage would not come into play in these cases. Insurance only comes into play to repair a vehilce when there is a covered claim."
17,Is  Life  Insurance  Acceptable  In  Islam?,"Do to its use of interest and chance there are those who believe that insurance is not permitted in Islam (i.e. that it is haram or sinful). Due to the spiritual nature of this question, you should seek the advice of an Imam for further guidance on Islam's position on insurance."
18,Will  Health  Insurance  Cover  A  Tubal  Reversal?,"Most insurance plans will not cover the reversal of a voluntary sterilization or any treatments designed to overcome infertility. There are fifteen states with insurance mandates requiring some form of coverage for infertility, but every one of these mandates specifically excludes covering reversal surgeries. The best alternative is to take advantage of the tax deductible expenses, and to buy extra coverage for any resulting pregnancy: lower deductible health insurance, short term disability, hospital indemnity."
19,How  Much  Life  Insurance  Can  You  Get  If  You  Have  Been  Diagnosed  With  Breast  Cancer?,"Traditionally, you can get up to 20-30x your income level of life insurance. The medical history does not necessarily limit how much you can get. The medical history determines the risk classification which controls the premiums for the coverage you want to put in place. When it comes to breast cancer, the details of the medical condition will determine which carriers will offer coverage and what the risk classification would be (each carrier has different underwriting, you may not get the same risk class offer from each of them), The best thing to do is to shop the case via an independent insurance agent/broker who can shop it to multiple companies. You do NOT want to apply to multiple companies as this can work against you due to the MIB (Medical Information Bureau) - from a company's point of view, it's sort of like a red flag if you will if they saw you applied to multiple companies which they can check the MIB for. In order to secure the most accurate quotes for the coverage, a number of factors would need to be known such as when the cancer was diagnosed, what stage is it in/was it in, how was it treated, has treatment been completed, are there anymore tests scheduled or that need to be completed, are you being treated for any other conditions, what prescriptions do you take, family medical history, and other factors. If you have a copy of the pathology report, that will help with a lot of the input. If cancer is current, guaranteed-issue whole life (GIWL) will be the only type of coverage available as it doesn't have any medical questions or exam requirements. However, the amount of coverage available under a single policy is $20,000-$25,000, depending on the carrier. To get more than that, you would need to stack multiple policies. Under GIWL policies, they traditionally feature a 2 or 3 year graded period - meaning you only have accidental death coverage during those periods, otherwise the carrier just returns the premiums paid into the policy if death occurs during the graded period. After the graded period expires, the full benefit is payable. Carriers typically only issue fully-underwritten coverage if the cancer has been in remission/treatment completed for at least 2 years. Many carriers prefer 5+ years from the date treatment was completed for a more favorable risk class. Send me a message via the ""contact me"" button by my profile picture if you would like me to assist with your coverage. My group is licensed with about 50 different carriers in numerous states. I hope the information is helpful - please let me know how I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
20,What  Do  I  Need  To  Register  For  Medicare?,If you have paid taxes into the system then enrollment is automatic. You should receive your Medicare card and a packet of information from Medicare shortly before you turn 65 or qualify for Medicare if you are on disability. If you do not receive your card by the time you turn 65 then you need to call your Social Security office or 1-800-MEDICARE.
21,Does  Short  Term  Disability  Insurance  Work?,"Short-term Disability does work if you have a qualifying disability. When you are applying for short or long-term disability, you need to look at the definition of disability and occupation. Not all companies have the same definition. If the definition is vague, you may find yourself being denied on your claim or receiving a ""lesser"" amount then what you have applied for."
22,Will  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Pool?,"In short, the answer is yes. But it needs to be clarified whether you are asking for property damage to the pool itself or liability coverage. Both would be covered barring any specific pool exclusions, which I am not aware of any in the standard market. If someone were to get injured while swimming in the pool, yes, your homeowners policy should cover you for liability. Likewise, if you pool is damaged due to the standard homeowners causes of loss less any standard exclusions then the pool would be covered for property damage to the pool itself. Keep in mind that wear and tear would not be covered under your policy. So if your pool liner rips ""just because"" or the concrete foundation cracks, those would be considered wear and tear. Please note that many insurance carriers are very cautious when writing homeowners insurance on homes that have pools. Some do not like to write them with a pool exposure, some do not mind, so be sure to ask your agent how it might affect your current coverage and future coverage and what the premium impact might be. You also want to strongly consider higher liability limits in purchasing an umbrella or if you already have an umbrella policy then higher umbrella limits. It might cost you $150 for each additional $1 mil limit. Lastly, if you have a pool and want to make sure you are covered for the proper limits, make sure your coverage B (other structures) limit is sufficient to cover any losses to your pool and any other structures i.e. detached garages, sheds as well."
23,When  Do  I  Have  To  Sign  Up  For  Medicare?,"You should sign up for Medicare in the three months before the month of your 65th birthday, the month of your 65th birthday, or in the three months following the month of your 65th birthday. If you miss that enrollment period you can sign up between Jan 1 and March 31 each year."
24,Will  An  MIP  Affect  My  Car  Insurance?,"That is a great question! If you are the minor in question with the possession charge, you better bet it will. If the minor was someone in your car with you, and not you, you might get lucky and the insurance company won't find out. Now the fact that you were allowing the breaking of the law, suggests that your decision making skills need some work, and that as a result, at some point yes, that will affect your policy, as you will most likely be filing some claims. Please consider this a serious wake up call. Too many teenagers die as a result of drunk driving, and you don't ( and neither does anyone else on the road with you) need to be another sad statistic. Seriously, stop. Thanks for asking."
25,Does  Blue  Cross  Blue  Shield  Have  Life  Insurance?,"Blue Cross / Blue Shield is the name of the network association for a number of health insurance companies (includes Anthem and CareFirst). Many health insurance companies do also offer life insurance programs, however, it's typically not the type of coverage they specialize in and the products may therefore not be as competitive as insurance companies who feature life insurance programs as the main type of insurance they offer. Insurance companies specializing in life insurance tend to have more aggressive underwriting and can offer lower rates because they want to secure that type of business more than others. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
26,What  Are  The  Advantages  And  Disadvantages  To  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"The advantages of coverage in your senior years can be significant based on the average senior couple spending $250,000 in medical costs during their retirement years. The disadvantage is the loss of economic opportunity to invest or save the premium dollars spent on long term care insurance if you never use it."
27,Will  Medicare  Pay  For  Life  Alert?,Medicare covers items that are considered medically necessary. This includes diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions caused by accident or illness. Medicare will also cover some DME (durable medical equipment) if prescribed by a doctor as part of your treatment plan. Services such as Life Alert are not considered medically necessary.
28,Which  Life  Insurance  Should  I  Buy?,"Product suitability is always a consideration when considering product lines that have such diverse application. Life insurance is generally purchased for indemnification or inheritance planning, but can be used as supplemental retirement income. Term life insurance is an excellent for temporary coverage for temporary financial exposure to your beneficiaries. For permanent liabilities, many planners use guaranteed universal life insurance. For supplemental retirement income there are several crediting methods: for interest rate crediting you can use participating whole life or current assumption universal life. If you desire access to domestic and/or foreign indices, you should review indexed universal life insurance. If your risk tolerance permits, you could consider variable universal life with access to separate sub accounts that use marker equities and bond instruments."
29,Does  Medicare  Pay  For  HPV  Screening?,"Medicare covers your annual exams including most women's gynocological exams and testing. As part of your pelvic exam and pap test, your doctor should screen for abnormalities including STD's, abnormal cells and HPV. The HPV virus has been linked to certain types of cervical cancer. You should have regular HPV screening and it is normally covered by Medicare"
30,Which  Is  The  Best  Life  Insurance  To  Get?,"The best life insurance to get is going to depend on many factors. The most prominent one being why are you taking out the policy. Otherwise, I would say a whole life policy is the one that will provide a lot of bang for the buck in most cases. To ensure that you get the policy that is right for you contact your local agent and discuss your needs and expectations so that they can direct you to the policy that best fits."
31,How  Much  Should  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Cost?,"Long term care insurance premiums will vary greatly according to age, health, features of the policy, and area in which the policy is purchased. However, you could look at the federal guidelines for how much premium can be exempted on income tax returns, to get a general guide for life insurance premiums. In 2013, they are: 40 and under: $360/single, $720/couple 41-50: $680/single, $1,360/couple 51-60: $1,360/single, $2,720/couple 61-70: $3,640/single, $7,280/couple 71 and up: $4,550/single, $9,100/couple"
32,How  Safe  Are  Fixed  Annuities?,"Tax deferred, fixed annuities are based on the contractual claims in the annuity policy. The contractual claims in the annuity policy are as good as the financial strength and claims paying of the annuity company that issued the policy. Generally, fixed interest rate annuities guarantee a rate for a period of time like 5, 7 or 10 years. The annuity insurance companys portfolio is generally dominated by government bonds."
33,How  Long  Does  It  Take  To  Settle  A  Life  Insurance  Claim?,"Life insurance death claims are generally filed by the beneficiaries of the policy. The beneficiaries contact the insurance company for their death claim forms and return them with an obituary and certificate of death. The process should take between 30 and 60 days. If the death occurred within the two year contestability period, a standard investigation will ensue which can delay payment."
34,Is  Car  Insurance  Credit  Checked?,When you are applying for auto insurance coverage most if not all insurance carriers will do what is called a soft pull of an insured's credit score. This soft pull normally will not adversely affect a persons credit rating. Credit score is only one part of the many factors that are taken into consideration when your rate is calculated.
35,Can  I  Use  HSA  To  Pay  For  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"Yes, you can use HSA to pay for long term care insurance premiums. There is a limit on the premiums for LTC insurance that can be paid through your health savings account. The instructions for your Section A (Form 1040) of your tax return will tell you the limit of premiums that can be deducted for your age group that year."
36,Can  Employers  Charge  Smokers  More  For  Health  Insurance?,"Yes. Application of a premium surcharge for tobacco users has become more common in recent years, primarily in larger groups who self-fund their employee benefits plans as the employer has much more control of the benefit plan design and rate structure than they do with fully insured plans. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), while doing away with pre-existing condition exclusions, does explicitly allow for the adjustment of rates for tobacco use. So, in that sense, tobacco users are the class of employees it is legal to discriminate or penalize for their personal behavior. The ACA is silent on the consumption of Marijuana which may present some interesting situations as more states move to allow the use of medical Marijuana or to legalize its recreational use."
37,What  Does  Home  Owners  Insurance  Usually  Cover?,"That's kind of a tough question to answer becuase many homeowners policies cover a multitude of things. In general terms if you house catches on fire, is broken into, is damaged by wind hail or lightning, your pipes burst, some body trips and falls on your proprty and gets hurt you could have a claims situation on your homeowners policy. This is just scratching the surface as every policy is different in every state. Most carriers add in a bunch of ""extra"" coverages too. To truly know what your homeowners policy covers, you need to do two things 1) Call you local independent agent and discuss you policy with them 2) Actually read your policy. I know reading a legal contract is your idea of fun night curled up by the fire, but it is in your best interest to actually read your entire policy, know what it includes and excludes and ask your agent about things you have questions on...."
38,How  Much  Does  An  Ultrasound  Cost  Without  Health  Insurance?,Ultrasound exams are usually a few hundred dollars when you have health insurance. The Health Care Blue Book shows a price of $158 for an abdominal ultrasound including physician fees. Ultrasound on other body parts may be more or less. You should ask your doctor about costs in advance and negotiate an acceptable rate.
39,What  Is  10  Yr  Term  Life  Insurance?,"That is a great question! A ten year term policy is one that provides you with the specified amount of coverage for the ten years as defined in your policy. On the day your policy expires, you have no more coverage, and no cash value or benefit to take from it. You can renew your policy, but it will dramatically increase in price. Typically a policy like this is to insure against a short term loss, like covering a college career, or a mortgage, or to provide a cheaper form of life insurance when money is tight. If you would like more details, please feel free to contact me, okay? Thanks for asking!"
40,Can  You  Put  Money  In  A  401K  And  A  Roth  IRA?,"That is an excellent question! Not only can you, but you should! It is an excellent strategy to maximize as much as you can afford to the amount you can contribute to your retirement funds. Contribute as much as you can to the 401 to earn the employer match, it's free money, in a way, and you should take advantage of it. Your Roth will allow $5500 a year ($6500 if you are 50+) and after your 401, contribute as much of that as possible. The earlier you start, the better, and by maximizing your contributions now, it will help balance out when the time comes that money is a little tighter, and you can't contribute as much. Thank you for asking!"
41,Can  I  Get  Health  Insurance  With  Hepatitis  C?,"You can purchase health insurance with Hepatitis C as a preexisting medical condition. There would be no waiting period before benefits begin, but time is quickly running out. The Affordable Care Act requires that health plans accept all applicants regardless of existing medical conditions. Applicants need to enroll in a plan during the annual open enrollment period through their state insurance exchange. The first open enrollment ends on March 31 of 2014 - in just a few days. Coverage would begin April 1. If you miss this open enrollment window you could enroll in plans with a January 1, 2015 effective date."
42,When  Can  I  Enroll  In  Medicare  Part  A?,"You will automatically be enrolled in Medicare when you reach age 65 provided you have worked long enough and paid into the system. You will have the choice to opt out of part B of Medicare, but I do not recommend it unless you are still working and in a group. You will also get Medicare if you are on Social Security Disability. There is about a two year wait when you get disability before you are eligible."
43,When  Did  Health  Insurance  Originate?,"That is a great question! There were some types of travelers insurances offered in the 1840's that covered you if your train crashed or steamboat sank, but other than that, there really wasn't much until the late 1800's when disability policies became popular. Britain passed a law in the early 1900's that created a ""National Health Insurance"", and most of Europe kind of adopted similar laws, but we didn't catch on until 1929 when us Texans ( Baylor University Hospital, and some local teachers, I think) created a system of standardized costs for hospital stays. Shortly thereafter came Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and then all kinds of competing companies. The history of insurance is interesting stuff. Thanks for asking!"
44,How  Important  Is  Health  Care  Insurance?,"Very important. Health insurance allows people to go and get health care if needed. Typically people with insurance will get check ups, find problems sooner due to early detection and can address health needs proactively. When you don't have health insurance you spend your days praying you never get sick. If at all possible strive to keep health insurance on yourself and your family."
45,How  Much  Does  It  Cost  To  Get  Renters  Insurance?,"Great question. Often clients are afraid to ask I think they believe is it expensive but actually its relatively inexpensive. Typically if you insure two vehicles with a company the discount you gain by having a second policy on your auto insurance will if not cover the cost of a renters policy it will be close! So the average cost is 60-120 dollars a year. So for ten dollars or less you have coverage for your phone, computers, books, clothes, medications, cd's, movies, art, guns or whatever else you own! Ten dollars a month is very inexpensive, also these are covered anywhere in the world!"
46,Does  My  Home  Insurance  Cover  Theft?,"It is important to talk to your insurance professional about the specific terms and conditions of your policy, but generally speaking, theft is a named covered peril in most Home Insurance policies. This would include theft of your personal property from within your home of course, but also includes theft of your property outside of your home. Personal property outside of your home is usually covered up to 10% of the total personal property amount listed in your policy. If covered, the loss settlement would be subject to your deductible. The claims specialist will also be looking for a copy or a police report."
47,How  Does  Renters  Insurance  Benefit  The  Landlord?,"That is a great question! The landlord needs to provide a safe environment for the tenants, and carries insurance on the property. To help protect the property manager/complex from a higher liability, your renters policy helps take some of that liability off of their shoulders. If you damage the apartment, or someone is injured in your apartment, your policy covers some or all of that claim, and not the landlords. Thanks for asking!"
48,Do  Ohio  Employers  Have  To  Offer  Health  Insurance?,"Employers in Ohio are required to offer health insurance to their workers although they can avoid any penalty if the family can not afford the healthcare benefits offered. Also, this penalty has been delayed until 2015 to give employers and insurers time to work on specific details of implementation. This tax penalty applies to companies with 50 or more workers and applies to workers and their dependents, including children under the age of 26. Technically, the law does not apply to spouses. ""Full-time"" would be considered working 30 hours per week. However, having 100 part-time workers working 20 hours per week would qualify as having 50 full-time workers. Here in Ohio, we have enjoyed low health insurance rates, and although required mandates will be raising premiums, there still will be many low-cost options.Most of the major insurers, including Anthem and Medical Mutual, will be participating in the State Health Exchange."
49,How  Much  Auto  Insurance  Should  I  Have?,"I always recommend the highest limits of liability that you can afford. If you have a good insurance score, and a clean driving record, the premium difference between 50/100 (50k per person/100k per accident) and 100/300 will not be much relatively speaking. Also, it is a good idea to have a high limit of liability for property damage, such as $100,000. The national average vehicle liability award in 2008 was $326,628. That said, I always recommend at least 250/500 limits of liability. Additionally, I always recommend having an ""umbrella policy"" to increase your limits of liability. Ask your insurance agent for a quote on a $1,000,000 umbrella policy. Be sure to tell your agent of all properties or vehicles titled to you."
50,Why  Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Increase?,"Homeowners Insurance is a contract whereby a homeowner transfers his/her risk to an insurance carrier in return for a contract and a small premium. Homeowners Insurance Premium will usually increase from year to year; however, by chance a decrease may be seen once in a while. Insurance companies increase the Dwelling Coverage each year to keep up with the increasing cost of reconstruction; after all, homeowners insurance's primary purpose is to rebuild a home in the unfortunate event of a total loss. The small increase of dwelling coverage each year is usually the purpose that draws attention when the premium rises; however, this is very insignificant. Insurance companies are audited each year and are obligated to comply with State Department of Insurance regulations in each and every State where they underwrite risk. Each year, insurance carriers calculate the necessary premium to maintain a safe financial condition and offer security to all homes insured; the largest reason for premium increase would be 'loss experience' during the prior year, another reason may be due to increased operational cost including but definitely not limited to reinsurance premium paid. Insurance Companies either have an internal actuarial department or hire an independent actuarial firm who are charged with the responsibility of calculating premium based on underwriting factors and prior loss data. For this reason, carriers only offer annual policies and are unable to predict risk on a longer term basis. Since carriers experience different loss results each and every year, insurance rates and increase percentages are never the same from one year to the next. Since paid losses continue to grow, claim frequency is showing growth and litigation is becoming more commonplace, insurance companies raise premium to keep up with the outflow of payments. It is important to recognize that claims and operational expenses are paid from the pool of collected policy premium. For a more detailed explanation or financial report from your current carrier, contact your carrier representative to receive a report. Also, data is available as published by the Department of Insurance in most States."
51,Who  Can  Buy  Medicare?,"That is a great question! The vast majority of people get Medicare when they are turning 65. The program will allow people under the age of 65 to enroll under certain conditions, like kidney failure, or if you have been on disability for a designated amount of time. The program is designed to help Senior Citizens afford health care, so unless you meet the exceptions, you will need to be 65 or older to enroll. Thanks for asking!"
52,How  To  Remove  Medicare  Part  B?,"--> Medicare makes it difficult to cancel, or withdraw from, Medicare Part B. Because Medicare Part B provides important coverage for most people 65 and older, and because there's a penalty if someone cancels Medicare but then later wants to enroll again, Medicare enrolls everyone automatically at age 65 and wants to make sure no one cancels their coverage without fully understanding the consequences."
53,At  What  Age  Should  I  Get  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"The best time to secure long term care insurance is when youre young and healthy, especially if you have a family history of chronic illness or nursing home confinement. Most advisers begin addressing long term care insurance with their clients and prospects around age 50. But in reality, most pre retirees purchase long term care insurance in their early 60s."
54,When  Are  Life  Insurance  Death  Benefits  Taxable?,"Typically, life insurance proceeds are not taxable. They pass on to the beneficiary tax-free and can be deposited into a pre-approved or pre-discussed account. Based on my 32 years of experience handling too many claims, the period of time is about 10-30 days for the check to arrive. In some circumstances, there could be estate taxes. Also, depending on the type of policy and how premiums were paid, there could be a taxable event. A full-time broker or financial planner is your best resource."
55,What  Are  Medicare  Savings  Programs?,"Medicare Savings Accounts (MSA) is a specific type of Medicare Advantage plan that may or may not be available in your area. Similar to the HSA (health savings account) for major medical plans, the MSA combines a high deductible Advantage plan with a tax favored savings account. These are not for everyone but there are definite advantages."
56,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Dog  Bites  To  Other  Dogs?,Dog bites would be covered under the liability portion of your homeowners policy. Dog bites have become a big deal over the last several years and dog bite can be a very expensive loss in some cases. For this reason many insurance companies have put exclusions on certain breeds of dogs and will not cover a dog bite. You would need to check with your specific insurance company to see if your breed of dog is covered should a dog bit occur. All agents should be having this discussion with the client before purchasing a policy.
57,What  Does  Medicare  Plan  A  Cover?,Medicare Supplement Plan A is required to be offered by all insurance companies who offer Medicare supplement plans. This plan covers 100% of the basic benefits that can be offered by insurance companies under a Medicare supplement plan and is suitable for individuals on a budget who want to have a little more coverage than what Medicare Part A and Part B provides. Medicare Supplement Plan A Covered Benefits: 1) Medicare Part A coinsurance plus coverage for 365 additional days after Medicare benefits are used up 2) Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment 3) First 3 pints of blood 4) Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayment Benefits not covered: 1) Skilled Nursing Facility Care coinsurance 2) Medicare Part A deductible 3) Medicare Part B deductible 4) Medicare Part B excess charges 5) Foreign travel emergency (up to plan limits) Medicare supplement plans can be purchased through an insurance agent/broker.
58,Is  Whole  Life  Insurance  A  Good  Option?,"The answer to any financial question should always be prefaced by ""it depends on the need of the individual"". That said, there are significant benefits for someone who owns a whole life participating policy. Whole life, a form of permanent life insurance, features guaranteed premiums, death benefits and cash value. Whole life policies also give you the potential to receive dividends which can increase the value of the policy or provide an increased death benefit for beneficiaries. Unlike term, the death benefit will last your entire lifetime and the monthly premium will be locked in at the date of policy inception according to your ""rating"". So, if you are 35 and get rated ""Preferred Non-tobacco"" that will give you a monthly premium that will not change for your entire life, regardless of any health issues - as long as your premiums are current. The second important value of whole life insurance is the accumulation of cash inside the policy on a tax-deferred basis. Over time, the cash value increases can be significant and you can borrow cash from your policy at a favorable interest rate. Many people have used this as a source for college funding or even a retirement income stream later in life. These policy loans are generally tax free. There is a lot more to Whole Life policies that can be addressed when considering your personal situation and I would recommend contacting an independent insurance agent that can review your particular needs and situation."
59,Can  Employers  Contribute  Different  Amounts  Health  Insurance?,"They can as long as they are not discriminating within a class of employees. For example, it is not uncommon for an employer to contribute on dollar or percentage amount towards the coverage of salaried employees and another dollar or percentage amount towards hourly employees. This is quite common where a labor union collectively bargained agreement is in place. Where an employer can get in trouble is where they choose to discriminate within the same class of employees. So, as a general rule all salaried employees should be treated the same from an employer contribution standpoint as should be the case with all hourly employees. Contributing 50% of the cost for one salaried employee and 75% of the cost for another similarly situated salariedemployee could be the grounds for a labor discrimination lawsuit for the employer."
60,What  Will  Happen  To  Medicare  In  The  Future?,"Medicare is ""too big to fail"" but that does not mean there won't be changes. Funding and benefits will need to be adjusted in order for the system to survive. Medicare is like a balloon. You squeeze in one place and it bulges in another. Going forward, medical providers will have reimbursements squeezed, deductibles and premiums will rise. The biggest threat to Medicare beneficiaries is the Obamacare IPAB that will oversee medical treatment."
61,Can  The  General  Life  Insurance?,I was not able to find a General Life Insurance Company. I did find General American Life Insurance which has been bought by Metlife Insurance. Metlife is a good strong company to work with. I would however recommend comparing rates for the type of insurance you are looking for as they will have different features.
62,Will  My  Auto  Insurance  Go  Up  If  Get  Ticket?,That will depend primarily on your insurance carrier andyour previous motor vehicle record. Each carrier has its own policies on how tickets and accidents are used in their auto insurance rating system. Somecarriers will not change your rates due to a single ticket or accident within a five year time period.
63,Does  Renters  Insurance  Include  Theft?,"If you're insured with a reputable company and a good agent, your renters policy should include theft. All a renters policy is is a homeowners policy without the building coverage. It's there to cover your stuff and your liability. It's rare, but there are companies that offer coverage that may not include theft. This coverage form is called ""Basic Form"" and it will not cover theft. Never, never, never accept a policy written on a basic form for your renters coverage. The most common form is Broad Form, and it will cover theft. Most companies and agents will use this when writing your renters policy. Don't accept anything less."
64,What  Is  A  Renters  Insurance  Policy?,"A renter's insurance policy covers your personal property when you do not own the residence you occupy. It also covers your liability, medical payments to others, additional living expenses and numerous other items. Typically, the cost is fairly cheap and an experienced broker in your area can easily compare the best plans for you."
65,How  Is  Home  Insurance  Calculated?,"Among the many factors typically used to determine homeowner insurance rates, here are a few of the key ones: Type of Construction, Age of Dwelling & Condition of Dwelling - Ex: Is the construction type 'fire resistant' rather than wood frame? Has the building been well cared-for? Claims Submission History - Ex: Does the prospect have a history of submitting claims on a frequent basis...especially smaller ones? Dwelling Location - Fire station proximity; History of frequent and /or severe losses in the area from wild fires, hurricanes, etc. Credit History - Credit score - Prevailing underwriting theory is that better credit scores equate to less possibility of frequent claim submissions. Additional Risk Factors - Swimming pools, with or without child safety devices; Questionable types of animals in terms of temperment, as relates to possible attacks on humans; Recreation equipment on premises - safety devices?"
66,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Sewer  Repair?,"No, under normal circumstances sewer repair would not be covered by your homeowners insurance policy. Remember every policy is different.

67,Does  AARP  Have  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"No, AARP does not carry Long Term Care insurance at this time.

To obtain Long Term Care quotes there are many online agencies that can assist you."
68,Is  Short  Term  Disability  Considered  Health  Insurance?,"No short term disability is a different policy than health insurance. Health insurance is designed to pay the providers, i.e. doctors, hospitals, clinics, etc. Short term disability is designed to pay you for the income that is lost due to an injury or illness. It can be used for medical expenses, food, mortgage or anything else needed to survive during a difficult time."
69,At  What  Age  Should  You  Get  Life  Insurance?,"Most people I talk to wish that they had bought their life insurance a few years ago. One man recently was kicking himself around the block for not doing so. Obviously, the older you are the closer the company is to the day that they will have to pay a death benefit. In other words, as you age you become a greater risk to the company and the company must charge more to compensate."
70,Is  Travelers  Home  Insurance  Any  Good?,In my personal opinion Travelers home insurance is a superior product. Also Travelers has excellent customer service and claims handling. As an independent agent I work with many different companies and the one that rises to the top and receives praises from my clients continually is Travelers Insurance. Make sure to discuss the details with an agent as Travelers has several package options ranging from Silver to Platinum.
71,Who  Can  Get  On  Medicare?,"You are eligible for Medicare by one of two ways. The most common entry into Medicare is when you turn 65. Most folks take advantage of Medicare eligibility at 65, but if you have good group insurance through your employer you can opt-out of Medicare until retirement without penalty. The other entry into Medicare is via qualifying for Social Security Disability prior to the age of 65."
72,Who  Has  The  Best  Rates  For  Renters  Insurance?,This is impossible to answer with the limited information provided here.

73,Who  Can  Drive  Your  Car  Under  Your  Insurance?,"All listed divers on your policy can operate your vehicles (assuming they are on your policy). Also, if you give permission to another person to drive your vehicle, and they are licensed and in good standing, they should be covered (assuming at-fault state). If another person steals your vehicle, you are covered for the damages they cause, although the insurer will certainly attempt to recover funds from them."
74,Can  Medicare  Pay  For  Nursing  Homes?,"Medicare can pay for nursing home stays under certain conditions: 1) The nursing home stay must be within 30 days of a qualified hospital stay in the hospital of at least days. 2) There must be a prescribed medical need for daily skilled nursing or rehabilitative care. 3) The facility must be Medicare approved. 4) Medicare will only continue as long as the patient is showing improvement. 5) The first 20 days are totally covered. Days 21-100 charge a co-payment that was $144.50 per day in 2012. After 100 days, Medicare no longer pays any benefits for nursing home care."
75,What  Happens  If  Car  Insurance  Lapses?,"If your car insurance lapses....pay that bill! Often, you have time where the insurer will accept your premium payment (but possibly with a lapse incoverage). If your policy has lapsed for a longer period of time, obtaining a new policy quickly is important. You should contact an experienced broker or a very reputable website with the idea of getting coverage that day. After reviewing multiple quotes, you can apply and purchase a policy (online, if you wish)."
76,Is  Garage  Door  Covered  By  Homeowners  Insurance?,A garage door is part of the dwelling so this means the garage door is covered by the same perils of the policy as the rest of the home minus your deductible. If it's attached to the home is part of the home. If it falls free then it's personal property and not dwelling.

81,What  Are  Some  Characteristics  Of  Whole  Life  Insurance?,"Whole Life, also called Permanent Life, will last for the rest of your life, so long as you pay your premiums. Unlike Term Life, which lasts for a specific predetermined number of years, at a guaranteed rate. Whole life will not go up in price and will not go down in coverage amount. It accumulates cash value, from which you are able to borrow funds, for such things as college, home down payment, or even retirement, or whatever else you desire. With the accumulation in a quality policy, you can fund your retirement, as a substitute for a pension. Thank you. GARY LANE."

86,What  Is  The  Tax  Penalty  For  Not  Having  Health  Insurance  Under  Obamacare?,"The first year penalty is only $95.00 and will gradually increase. In 2016 the penalty will be adjusted to the CPI or Consumer Price Index. Most people will qualify for a subsidy to pay the monthly premium. Those individuals between 133% & 400% of FPL or Federal Poverty Level. The amount varies by state, in NM for example, if an individual makes less than $45,900 Modified Adjusted Gross Income, & $92,000 for a couple filing jointly, they will qualify for a tax subsidy. The less you make the larger the subsidy. There is catastrophic coverage available for those under 27 years of age.

87,Can  You  Lose  Medicare  Benefits?,"This is a great question. The only time I have seen someone's Medicare terminate is when they stopped paying the bill. Normally part A is at no cost and there is a cost for part B. For most, part B is taken directly from the social security check, but sometimes there is no social security check and Medicare sends a bill. So the short answer is Yes."
88,Will  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  A  Lost  Diamond?,"Homeowner's insurance can potentially pay for a lost diamond if you have it ""scheduled"" on your policy. When this is done, you are covering the ring for a specified amount, and generally all risks are covered. The premium charged is in addition to the regular policy premium. There also may be a rider that extends coverage to include that risk, althoughschedulingis often the best option."
89,How  Much  Do  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Policies  Cost?,"The cost of a typical long term care insurance policy depends on gender, age and health condition.

To be sure of the performance, or lack thereof, you need to order an in force ledger from the life insurance company."
91,What  Age  Do  You  Go  On  Medicare?,"Most people go on Medicare at age 65. You cannot get on Medicare at a younger age unless you meet the guidelines for qualification while having Lou Gherig's Disease or End Stage Renal Disease, or if you have been receiving Social Security Disability benefits for at least two years."
92,How  Can  Life  Insurance  Companies  Tell  If  You  Are  A  Smoker?,"Life insurance companies can tell if you are a smoker by testing blood and urine, by asking about tobacco use on the application, sometimes by doing a phone interview, and sometimes by looking at medical records. The insurance companies can't always tell, but it is surprising how many people get caught using tobacco when they think they won't. And once that trust is broken between what was stated and what is true, the underwriters don't give you much benefit of the doubt for anything else."
93,How  To  Determine  If  You  Need  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"Ask yourself these questions: Do you own your home? Do I want to pass it to my family? What about my other assets? If I had to go to a nursing home do I want to have to spend down my assets to qualify for Medicaid? What will my family do if this happens? Proper planning can help insure that when your time comes that you need care your family will not have to suffer the burden of taking care of your personal needs. Help will be available to allow you to stay at home rather than being forced into a nursing home and losing all your hard earned money and assets.

94,Who  Made  Car  Insurance  Mandatory?,"If car insurance is mandatory, there are two possible entities that make it so - either your State Department of Motor Vehicles or your auto loan or leasing company. Usually these days it is both. Most states require car insurance as part of their procedure for registering a car. In all cases if you have a loan, the lender will require you to carry both Comprehensive and Collision coverage in order to be sure that their interest is protected. If you are leasing your car, not only will Comp and Collision be required, but Liability coverage as well."
95,When  Should  I  Get  Term  Life  Insurance?,"The best time to get coverage is obviously the day before we die! Now, since most of us don't know when that is or will be, the best decision you can make is to get coverage if you have responsibilities to others. Whether it be for a loan repayment or college education and money for a spouse, make sure this is something you do NOT put off."
96,What  Does  Credit  Have  To  Do  With  Auto  Insurance?,"Many insurers utilize credit scores when determining the auto insurance rate a customer will pay. The reason is that often, there is a direct correlation and relationship with bad credit and higher incidence of accidents. Although the discount or surcharge may not be large, it is till worthwhile to be aware of your current credit rating and take steps to monitor and improve it."
97,Will  Home  Insurance  Pay  For  Roof  Replacement?,"It may if your roof was damaged by a covered incident less your policy deductible. Many homeowners policies have a different deductilbe for wind, hail, or roof claims. Please remember every policy is different. Read your policy completely to understand the coverage provided and any exclusions that there may be."
98,Who  Has  The  Best  And  Cheapest  Car  Insurance?,"This is a difficult question to answer because all companies are different in what makes up their ideal market. Some companies specialize in 30+ year olds, others in young drivers. Local has a lot to do with car insurance rates as well. In addition, insurance rates are based off the type of coverage an individual is seeking. So to say one company is the best and cheapest is really impossible to do. I would suggest contacting an agent in your state and provide them information specific to you. They should be able to narrow companies down that will suite your individual needs. Then compare coverage and rates to find the best company for you!"
99,Can  You  Rent  A  Uhaul  With  Car  Insurance?,"I not certain how having or not having automobile insurance would have an effect on renting a Uhaul trailer. If you are asking if your automobile insurance would extend to covering the rented Uhaul, the answer is maybe. Your automobile insurance liability coverage will typically travel with the insured not the vehicle, but comprehensive and collision coverage do not travel with the insured theyprovide coverage for thevehicle listed on the policy."
100,What's  Covered  In  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Let me add a few comments here on how the coverages are usually presented on a Declaration page of a Homeowners policy. First there is the party being insured and who the company is that is providing the insurance. Then there is a specific term for the coverage to begin and end. Then there are many ways to then itemize the coverage, but here are some basics. The policy is usually divided into two Sections .Section I deals with property insurance and Section II Liability Insurance, so within the section I coverages there are usually four parts Coverages A,B, C, D. Coverage A is the Dwelling Coverage. This can be sold on an Actual cash value basis ( very infrequently, but watch out for it ) usually on a 100 % of the dollar value of the estimated cost to replace the house itself. This is often difficult for consumers to understand, but no one really cares about the market value. What is important is the replacement cost and replacing one house destroyed is usually a lot more expensive then building one new in a subdivision. Make sure you have enough coverage. This is not an exact science so many companies offer extensions to increase the coverage beyond the stated value. Next is Coverage B : These are the other structures appurtenant, outbuildings, fences, Gazebos unattached garages etc. Coverage C is usually Personal Property or Contents Coverage. This is very important to understand :You want replacement cost coverage not Actual Cash Value, ACV. The easiest way to think of this is the ten your old large and 200 lb TV. The ACV is going to be next to nothing. There is no continuing interest in buying that type TV anywhere. But replacing it with a new TV with light weight plasma features is what you want. Coverage D is Additional Living Expense. This can be stated two different ways or a mixture of the two. Some companies list a maximum dollar limit available. Others list a maximum time limit and still others list a maximum time limit and dollar limit. This covers the additional cost of living elsewhere while your home is reconstructed. It can also come into play if a Governmental authority won't let you near your home for safety reasons ( i.e. forced evacuation form an impending hurricane).This coverage does not pick up the cost of things you would normally pay out of pocket, but the additional things and costs necessary to keep your household going while your home is repaired. The next set of coverages comprise Section II or liability coverage. Coverage E is very broad and covers such things as an injury to a child by your dog, or an inadvertent collapse of you deck with guests on it etc. Coverage E then is is sold in increments of 100,000 usually. The difference in price from say 300,000 to 500,000 is usually only a few dollars a year. If you have an umbrella policy, you may be required to carry a minimum of 500,000 in coverage. Coverage F is Medical payments coverage. This is usually quite nominal and is used to cover minor incidents where fault may not be much of an issue, but you feel obliged to pay for the medical bill. For example a neighbor picks up your mail for you while you are gone and trips on your garden hose. The injuries are not serious, but do require a couple stitches . The limit is low because the much more serious incidents would require negligence or absolute liability and would fall under Coverage E. I hope this helps. If you are in AZ.CA,TX, MO, or GA we'll be glad to assist you with placing your homeowners coverage."
101,Can  I  Buy  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  For  My  Mother?,Technically you can pay for it as long as she agree's and signs the application. She will also need to qualify. If she is in good health there should be no problem. The premium will be based on her age. Sit down with an agent knowledgeable in Care Resource Planning and determine the best plan of action in planning for the care of your mother when she needs it most.
102,What  Is  A  Fully  Paid-Up  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"A fully paid up life insurance policy is one in which the premiums are paid up, or paid in full. At that point, the insurance company is liable for paying the death benefit, and you do not need to pay any more premiums to keep the policy in effect."
103,Can  I  Get  Life  Insurance  With  Hypertension?,"Yes, you can get life insurance with hypertension. If your life insurance is well controlled with one medication, you can be rated as good as Preferred or even the class higher than that, if your other health details and build fit that. If you are on more than two medications, if your hypertension has been uncontrolled recently, and/or if you have some other health conditions connected to your hypertension, you may be rated up or need to take a simplified issue policy. A good impaired risk life insurance agent can shop the best companies for your hypertension details, because different company rates differently."
104,How  To  Find  Good  Renters  Insurance?,"The key to finding a good renters policy is to find a good insurance agent. If you dont have a trusted agent, get referrals from friends colleagues or neighbors. A good agent will listen to you, offer sound financial advice and communicate clearly with you and the insurance company. Selecting the limits of the policy is critical. This is where the agent will earn his commission. If you have a loss and the coverage is inadequate, nothing else matters."
105,What  Is  Considered  A  Sports  Car  For  Insurance  Purposes?,"Every year, make and model of automobile that a particular company is willing to insure has a symbol that determines the rating factors that are going to be applied. The symbol is the result of company experience and industry experience. If a car has a history of high repair costs it will be assigned a high symbol, regardless of the appearance or name you give the vehicle. Cars with low weight and high horsepower (sports cars) generally have high repair costs and a high symbol. Cars with expensive parts can also be assigned a high symbol."
106,What  Is  Covered  Under  Home  Insurance?,"Home insurance is designed to cover sudden and accidental losses. Home insurance is not a maintenance policy and it does not cover long term damage or wear and tear. Home insurance provides coverage for your dwelling, other structures (fence, shed ect.), personal property and liability coverage. There are several optional coverages available including Water/Sewer Backup, Law and Ordinance, Earthquake, ect. You also want to make sure you purchase a Replacement Cost policy which will provide full value for your home, not a depreciated amount."
107,Why  Is  It  Important  To  Plan  For  Retirement  Now?,"The longer you plan for retirement, the beterchance you have of being able to retire. You never know what curve balls life is going to throw your way. Putting away money while you can is always the best strategy. Even if you go into retirement with no debt, it can take 70% of your pre-retirement income to maintain the lifestyle you want to lead. Starting now will give you time to reach your goals without having to sweat too much if you get sidetracked along the way."
108,Why  Do  Guys  Pay  More  For  Car  Insurance?,"Car insurance rates are rarely a moral issue. If guys have worse driving records than young women, the company can ask many states to allow them to rate them separately. In California, that isnt an option. There are only a few rating factors in California and sex isnt one of them. That doesnt make insurance cheaper, it merely means that there isnt a distinction between male and female drivers in California."
109,How  Cheap  Is  Mobile  Home  Insurance?,"There's many options for mobile home insurance. Some companies will write this on a standard HO-3 form. An example of a price on a $100,000 value of the ""dwelling"" would be around $350-$500/yr depending upon claims, credit & location of the home."
110,Can  I  Get  Life  Insurance  After  Breast  Cancer?,"The short answer is yes, you can buy life insurance after cancer. The type, amount and terms depends on the cancer itselfand how long you have been cancer free after your last treatment. To get into the standard ratings after breast cancer practically all carriers will want to see you cancer free for 10 years. Anything less than10 yearswill be a higher risk policy of either rated premiums or graduated benefits."
111,How  Many  People  Use  Disability  Insurance?,"Outside of group disability benefit plans at work, individuals owning disability insurance is shockingly small when compared to the staggering statistical odds of a disability occurring once in your working lifetime causing you to be disabled an average of 30 months. Who has enough savings in this economy to cover that? Not many!"
112,Who  Is  Covered  Under  Your  Auto  Insurance?,"This depends upon your state and your insurance carrier. I will first speak generally then about the Michigan rules. General: anyone who is a family member and living in your home is covered by your auto insurance. Anyone who is borrowing your car with your permission is covered. Those are the major general coverage. Michigan: no-fault insurance goes like this 1. owner of the car, 2. driver of the car, 3. someone in the car, 4. a household family member who has no-fault. The general trend in Michigan is to find someone with insurance and make a claim against it, to prevent a mini-tort. I hope this helps."
113,What  Is  A  Medigap  Plan?,"Medigap plans (commonly referred to as Medicare supplement plans) are designed to help seniors who want high quality healthcare and are on Medicare, cover the gap between what hospitals and doctors charge for their services and what Medicare will pay.Health insurance is constantly changing, which can make finding the right plan for you very strenuous. Supplementing your Original Medicare coverage (Medicare Parts A & B) with a Medicare Supplement plan will help you create a very predictable expense structure for your healthcare and allow you to see any doctor you want that accepts Medicare. Any doctor that accepts Medicare will also accept your Medicare Supplement plan. There are 10 different Medicare supplement plans and they are all standardized, meaning a plan F from company A and a plan F from company B feature the EXACT same benefits. The 10 different plans available are plans A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, and N (a high-deductible plan F is also available that features a $2,140 deductible in 2014 - the trade-off being a substantially reduced premium). Each plan offers certain benefits some more comprehensive than others. Each plan must cover a core set of benefits (also known as the basic benefits). The basic benefits are: 1) Medicare Part A coinsurance plus coverage for 365 additional days after Medicare benefits are used up. 2) Medicare Part B coinsurance or copayment 3) First 3 pints of blood 4) Part A hospice care coinsurance or copayment There's a total of 9 benefits that can be secured. The other 5 benefits available under a Medigap plan are: 1) Skilled Nursing Facility Care coinsurance 2) Medicare Part A deductible 3) Medicare Part B deductible 4) Medicare Part B excess charges 5) Foreign travel emergency (up to plan limits) Each plan features a different structure, Each plan covers a different combination of these 9 benefits (some of the plans feature coinsurance or copayments for certain benefits). If cost is not a major factor for you, Plan F will be the recommended choice because it covers all 9 benefits at 100% - it's the most popular plan by far. If you're looking to keep your costs down, but still have very comprehensive coverage, you may want to look at plans C, G, and N as well. When you're looking to buy a Medigap plan, you should consult with an independent Medigap insurance agent to review the plans in detail to see which one will best serve your needs, help you identify all of the carriers offering Medigap plans in your zip code, and which one will be able to offer the coverage to you at the lowest cost (the plans are standardized so the biggest difference between them is price - the benefits are exactly the same regardless of the carrier you have the Medigap plan through). I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your Medigap coverage needs, including quotes and plan comparisons, and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
114,How  To  Add  A  Dependent  To  Health  Insurance?,"Dependent children can be covered under their parent's health insurance policies up to age 26. The main questions are the timing of your wanting to add this dependent to your coverage or if a change of life status event has occurred that allows for the addition of a dependent to your policy. If it's renewal time for your coverage then it's simply a matter of requesting the paperwork to add thedependent to your coverage. In the context of group health insurance plans it is quite likely that if it is outside of your plan's open enrollment period that a change of life status event will have to occur for you to be able to add your dependent to your coverage. The most common change of life status events are marriage, divorce, birth of a child, adoption of a child or loss of other health insurance coverage. If you had the dependent during your last open enrollment period and did not add them to your group's policy at that timeand there has been no change of life status event in the interim you will almost certainly have to wait until your group's next open enrollment period. Also, in one of the quirks of ObamaCare, spouses are not technically defined as dependents (I know, it doesn't make any sense but remember our politicians didn't read the law before they passed it). So, with health insurance rates rising sharply you are seeing more employers not providing spousal coverage, or allowing spouses to be covered only of they do not have coverage available through their employers (if they have one), or you may see an extra charge assessed for covering a spouse that has crappy coverage elsewhere. Just a word of warning regarding possible surprises you might encounter in wanting to add a spouse to your coverage."
115,How  Long  Does  Long  Term  Disability  Insurance  Last?,"The general rule of thumb for long term disability is to age 65. However there are disability insurance companies that offer longer or extended coverage. Then theres Lloyds of London, a company the prices risk outside the convention insurance market, in this case disability for high risk insureds or older insureds."
116,Is  Whole  Life  Insurance  Bad?,"The death rate is 100%. The question then is, when will it occur? Term insurance will provide coverage for a limited period to time. Whole life insurance will provide the same coverage for the lifetime of the insured. Unless you die within the period of coverage of the term policy, the whole life policy will always be a superior buy. Unlike the term policy, the whole life policy premium remains constant and the policy develops cash values that can be used for other purposes. The whole life policy doesnt increase in cost just at the time that you need it."
117,What  Is  The  Average  Car  Insurance  Rate  In  Utah?,"Auto insurance is priced based on several variables including: The type of car covered The age, gender, and marital status of the insured The coverage amounts elected by the insured For this reasons it's difficult to say exactly what you'd pay for coverage in any specific state However it is potentially noteworthy that Utah ranks number 12 within the nation for cheapest states in which to purchase auto insurance. This statistic comes from Bankrate."
118,Does  Great  West  Life  Cover  Travel  Insurance?,"The greatwestlife.com website says this about Travel Insurance: ""Our Global Medical Assistance group plan enhancement to your group healthcare plan is designed to provide worldwide assistance to travellers in emergency medical situations, wherever and whenever the need arises."" It states that coverage is up to $1,000,000 per covered trip and that they rate the trip on a scale of 1-6, with the option to cover trips that last up to 30 days. Visit their website for more accurate information and to contact Great-West Life."
119,Does  Term  Life  Insurance  End  At  A  Certain  Age?,"Yes generally term insurance policies end or expire at a certain age. The exact age depends on the particular policy, but age 85 is common. Term insurance polices are often renewable and convertible. That means that they renew for a higher premium at the end of each term 10,20,or 30 for example. It also means that up tp a specified age you can convert them to a level premium permanent insurance plan that does not expire before you do. An independent life insurance broker representing several companies can help you find the right policy at the right price."
120,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Firearms?,"Most insurance companies will have internal limits of $1000 for property coverage of firearms. If you are speaking about ""accidental discharge"" of a firearm that causes damage to something or someone I would need you to refer to your specific policy. In NY some companies will specifically exclude bodily injury from a firearm. Hope this answer helps."
121,What  Is  Net  Asset  Value  Of  A  Mutual  Fund?,"The Net Asset value of a Mutual Fund is the fund's value per share market value. This is the price investor buy fund shares from the mutual fund company. It is calculated by dividing the total assets of the fund, cash stocks and other securities less any outstanding liabilities by the toal number of shares outstanding. The calculation is done daily based on closing market values. If you have further questions, or feel that I could be of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.If you would like to work with a local Retirement Planner, you could start with a Google search. For example, if you search for: retirement planner Halifax or retirement planning Halifax, my name, along with several others, will come up. You can use the same method to find Retirement Planners in your community."
122,Which  States  Have  The  Best  Health  Insurance?,"There is no objective answer to your question. The term ""best"" means different things to different people. In general terms states that have more health insurance carriers offering their services will have more competition and more choices for consumers which may translate into lower average costs and more options than a state with more limited competition within its boundaries. But no one can really say, for example, that California has better health insurance than Florida, just that you will have different options and different price points (even from a national health insurance company like AETNA or CIGNA)."
123,Why  Is  It  Important  To  Plan  For  Retirement?,"It's very important to plan for retirement. You need to pay yourself first, which is exactly what retirement planning is. Paying your self today will determine how you live tomorrow."
124,How  Much  Disability  Insurance  Is  Enough?,"Typically disability insurance benefits are equal to a maximum of 60% of the insured's income. The maximum one can buy then is based on the annual income of the individual. If you can live comfortably on a lesser amount than 60% of what you earn, then you may consider buying a policy that would pay less than 60% of your earned income."
125,What  Does  Rider  Mean  In  Life  Insurance?,"A life insurance rider works just like any contract rider. It is an extension to the contract that stipulates an additional obligation by one or both of the parties to the contract. Specifically to life insurance, this would be any benefit made available by the life insurer that is optional to the policy owner to select that is not part of the base policy features."
126,How  Much  Do  You  Pay  For  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"Your premium price tag depends on your gender, age, smoking status, health history, current medical condition and paramed exam results. Your premium price tag is also dependent on your behaviors like: motor vehicle violations, dangerous recreational activities and vocational hazards. A nonsmoking married couple in good health and both age 60 will pay around $300 a month for a long term care policy with an inflation rider for $7,000 of monthly benefit and total benefit of $420,000."
127,What  Can  I  Claim  On  Renters  Insurance?,"There are two key words, damage and lawsuit. If you suffer damage and it is the result of a specified peril you can claim the loss of personal property up to the limits of the policy. The adjustment will be the cash value of the property lost minus the deductible. When you actually replace the property, there can be a further adjustment if you have replacement coverage If you are sued for property damage or bodily injury the renters policy will defend and pay judgment up to the limit of the policy (that is why it is so important to take the highest limit offered!)"
128,What  Does  Health  Insurance  Rated  Mean?,"A rated health insurance plan is one that includes a premium surcharge or load. The standard or preferred rate is insufficient to support the risk presented by the individual applying for health insurance. In some cases the surcharge is temporary while some conditions may result in a permanent load. Examples of a temporary load include tobacco use or excessive weight. Once the individual has stopped using tobacco products for a designated time period, or weight loss has been achieved and maintained, the premium loads may be removed."
129,How  Would  You  Calculate  The  Expected  Return  On  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Before you break out your HP12c calculator, consider this. Almost all proposals illustrate internal rate of return on both death benefit and cash values. If you have an existing life insurance policy you can order whats called an in force ledger and request the internal rate of return on both death benefit and cash values."
130,Can  I  Get  Auto  Insurance  Without  A  Driver  License?,I would have to say no. Every auto insurance carrier that I am aware of requires a drivers license number of all drivers that are to be covered by a policy. For a carrier to take on a risk that does not have a drivers license and is not getting insurance to have their license re-instated would possibly be a very unprofitable thing for the company to do.
131,When  Is  A  Person  Eligible  For  Medicare  Part  D?,"Eligibility to enroll in Medicare Part D is at the same time as one is eligible to enroll in Medicare Part A, B and C. This is usually age 65 or when one starts receiving SSDI. There are certain times when one can sign up for Medicare Part D. Visit this website for details: WEBSITELINK"
132,Is  Auto  Insurance  A  Federal  Requirement?,"Auto Insurance is not a requirement mandated by Federal law, but instead is required by most if not all states as a condition of registering a car for use on public access roads and highways. Property and Casualty insurance, including car insurance is regulated by state authority as opposed to the Federal Government."
133,Can  You  Get  Auto  Insurance  With  Bad  Credit?,"There are several non-standard insurance carriers that will not factor in your credit even for rating purposes. As many have mentioned, many companies will use it to factor your rates due to the likelyhood that a person with good credit usually will always pay on time and will remain a long term customer, of course there is always the exception and the customers who shop around each renewal either way."
134,Does  HIPPA  Apply  To  Life  Insurance  Companies?,"Legally, life insurance companies to not have to adhere to HIPPA. However, most life insurance companies utilize an application that includes a HIPAA form that must be signed so that the life insurance companies can access your medical information and complete their underwriting process."
135,How  Much  Does  Auto  Insurance  Cost  After  A  DUI?,"The increase that you experience in your auto insurance rates after an accident, ticket, or even a DUI can vary greatly depending on the insurance carrier that you are with. The change to your auto rates could vary anywhere from zero to two or three times your current rate or possibly more. Contact your local agent they should be able to advise you of the carriers current policy on rate changes for clients that experience a DUI."
136,How  Much  Is  Insurance  When  Buying  A  Home?,"Lenders normally require a mortgage holder to provide hazard insurance to cover the lenders interest in the property. This is normally interpreted to mean, a homeowners policy. The amount of coverage requested by the lender does not necessarily match the replacement cost for the residence. In California the mortgage holder cannot be forced to carry insurance in excess of the replacement cost of the residence. Your insurance agent can compute the cost of the policy that you require."
137,What  Is  The  Medigap  Policy?,"Your Medigap policy is designed to cover all Medicare approved Part A and Part B claims. Some plans, such as Medigap plan F, cover Part A and B deductibles and coinsurance. Other plans, such as plan G covers everything that is covered by F EXCEPT your Medicare Part B annual deductible."
138,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  A  Lost  Engagement  Ring?,"Your renters insurance may provide some limited coverage for a lost engagement ring less your deductible. Many renters policies will provide limited coverage for jewelry, electronics, appliances, and other personal items. Please remember every policy is different. Read your plicy completely to understand the coverage provided and any exclusions that there may be within."
139,Does  Obamacare  Cover  Medigap?,"No, Obamacare does not cover Medigap, or any other Medicare related expenses. In fact, Obamacare actually calls for over $700 BILLION in cuts to the Medicare system over its first ten years, a budgetary item that places the benefits available to our country's senior citizens at tremendous risk. The benefits of Obamacare are only available to those under the age of 65, which basically equates to this law taking money away from caring for our nation's seniors to secure coverage for younger individuals, at least those younger Americans that do not make enough income to cover the cost of coverage themselves."
140,How  Much  Is  Nationwide  Renters  Insurance?,"The cost of renters insurance from Nationwide will depend on several factors including the value of your items kept in the apartment or house, the location of the building, the age of the building, and your heating source within the building. Based on the variability of all these items, it's nearly impossible to answer this questions without more information about these items."
141,Who  Sells  Mortgage  Life  Insurance?,"The lender that provides your home loan is typically the vendor that sells mortgage life insurance to you, as well. When death occurs, the lender is paid the benefit of the policy, so that their portion of your loan is paid off. Life insurance can be used to cover a mortgage, however. It is more competitively priced than mortgage insurance and the death benefit does not decrease as your loan decreases. The beneficiary is the person of your choice. They can use the money to pay off the mortgage, or else spend it on other things if it makes more sense to keep the mortgage."
142,Does  My  Life  Insurance  Cover  Skydiving?,"When you applied for the life policy you probably had to indicate if you were involved in skydiving. If at the time that you completed the application you answered that truthfully and the company did not exclude skydiving from your policy, you are probably covered. If there isnt an exclusion for skydiving and the policy is more than two years old, you are probably covered. The statements on an application are representations and must be factually correct to the best of your knowledge."
143,Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  Skin  Removal  Surgery?,"It will depend upon your medical situation; 1) No Scenario (the most likely) - the skin removal is for cosmetic purposes. This is generally understood to extend to persons who have meaningful weight loss that leaves them with excess skin. So, you may have done the right thing by losing a lot of weight but you may have to reconcile yourself to living longer with a flabbier body or privately pay for cosmetic surgery. 2) Yes Scenario (uncommon but not rare) - where medically necessary criteria are met. There are circumstances where there can be recurring health problems caused by skin overhang (yeast infections, sores and rashes, infections, etc.) that can be remedied or mitigated by removing the overhanging skin, a Panniculectomy. This is not the same procedure as what is commonly referred to as a ""tummy tuck."" The Punniculectomy only removes the overhanging skin and does not address the stretching of abdominal muscle that can also occur and which is commonly addressed in the ""tummy tuck"" procedure. As such, depending upon the terms of your policy and how a claim is coded I can foresee the situation where both procedures are performed (if the doctors went on and did the more invasive abdominal muscle procedures while ""they were in there"" and this was done with your prior consent or request) and part of the procedureis covered by the policy and the other part being deemed for cosmetic purposesand not being covered."
144,How  Much  Does  It  Cost  To  See  A  Dermatologist  Without  Health  Insurance?,"The cost of seeing a dermatologist without health insurance could cost between $50 and $500, depending on tests that are performed, the cost structure of the physician, the area where you live, and what special offers the physician gives to consumers without coverage. You can always ask in advance and ask if there is a ""break"" since you are not covered."
145,Where  To  Get  Health  Insurance  With  A  Preexisting  Condition?,"Starting January 1, 2014 you cannot be denied coverage or charged more for health insurance on individual plans purchased either off or on the government's Marketplace Exchange. If you are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, those programs cannot refuse you either with a pre-existing condition. Open enrollment is now going on for these plans. The only exception is grandfathered health care plans that you purchase yourself, not through an employer. These plans must have been purchased on or before March 23,2010 and not have changed or reduced their benefits to the insured to be considered grandfathered plans."
146,Does  USAA  Sell  Life  Insurance?,"USAA does indeed sell life insurance. USAA (United Services Automobile Association) is a Texas based insurance carrier founded in 1922 to serve the financial needs of past and present members of our armed forces. USAA life insurance plans can be very competitive in some situations. You should always compare rates to other carriers when shopping for life insurance. You should also factor in underwriting, which can significantly impact the final rate."
147,Does  The  Federal  Government  Have  Disability  Insurance?,"Yes, the federal government has disability insurance called Social Security Disability Insurance. You pay into it when you pay your Social Security taxes. If you are 31 or older, you must have worked at least 5 of the last 10 years to qualify for SSDI benefits. If younger, the requirement is lower. You must also be determined medically disabled."
148,What  Is  A  Life  Insurance  Unit?,"A life insurance unit is $1,000. Life insurance is priced per unit. So if you wanted to purchase a $500,000 life insurance policy that costs $2.00 per unit, the cost of the policy would be $1000 per year, plus policy fee. Most people do not see the unit price when purchasing life insurance, but buying a child rider is a time when the unit price is often shown and you are given the chance to pick how many units you want you want in the rider."
149,How  Much  Is  Disability  Insurance  On  Average?,"On average, long term disability insurance costs 1% to 3% of the annual salary for men; slightly higher for women. There are many features to a Disability Insurance policy that can make it cost more. Some are important, some not so important. Most people will have to pick and choose to keep the Disability insurance premium within their budget but still get the important features."
150,Can  You  Surrender  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"You certainly can surrender a policy for its cash value, but then you have no life insurance. It would be much better for most folks to just borrow money from their policy and either pay it back or not. With a surrender, you will have to pay tax, but with a loan you will not, even if you do not pay it back, and you would still have a smaller but existing life insurance policy. Pay it back later and the death benefit returns automatically to the full amount! Call me, Gary Lane, Agent, New York Life, 949 797 2424. Thanks."
151,Is  Life  Insurance  Considered  Income?,"No, life insurance is not usually considered income for income tax purposes. If you receive the death benefit in regular payments rather than a lump sum, the interest only will be considered income. There are some caveats to this, especially with cash value policies. But generally speaking, life insurance is not counted as income."
152,When  Should  I  Get  Disability  Insurance?,"You should secure disability coverage as soon as you begin working full time. Disability insurance is paycheck protection. Most Americans have 90 days in cash reserves, so a disability could be financially devastating. The odds of experiencing a disability event are much higher than death, so its an important part of defensive planning."
153,How  Much  Does  It  Cost  For  Renters  Insurance?,"Individual residences are unique. So are the premiums for renters insurance plans. Check with people who have similar units. Find out what their limits are, from that you can come pretty close to an estimate of what it might cost you. Contact an agent that you trust. Have them design a policy and then you will know exactly what one company will charge for the renters policy."
154,Does  New  Hampshire  Require  Auto  Insurance?,"New Hampshire does not require you to have auto insurance. However, you are required, by law, to meet the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Requirements. If you can no meet these requirements, your license may be suspended. Sufficient funds must be available in case you have an accident that is your fault. The requirements are $25,000 per person, $50,000 per accident and an additional $25,000 of property damage. $1,000 of medical payments coverage is required if the vehicle is for personal use. Most persons purchase car insurance policies. An experienced broker will provide the lowest available rates for you in New Hampshire from the best carriers."
155,How  Much  Of  Your  Salary  Is  Covered  By  Disability  Insurance?,"Along with what Peggy said, it's important to note that you can always receive more benefit when you start making more money. Some people think, ""Oh, I don't want to buy it now because I'll be making more money in a few years."" Don't make that mistake! You can either add a future increase rider to your policy (to avoid medical underwriting), or you can just apply for a second policy when the time comes."
156,Which  Pharmacies  Accept  Medicare?,"If you have a Medicare Part D (Prescription Drug Plan), you should be able to call your Part D insurance company to find out which pharmacies are in your area that accept your Plan. Another way to find out which pharmacies accept your Medicare Part D plan is to visit medicare.gov and choose the tab that says Drug Coverage (Part D). Scroll to the bottom of the list and select Find Health and Drug Plans. You will now be on a page titled Medicare Plan Finder. Enter your zip code in the General Search box and click on the Find Plans button. You are now on a page that is Step 1 of 4. Complete the appropriate information for the questions asked and click the Continue to Plan Results question. Step 2 of 4 asks you to enter your drugs. Youll need to enter the name of at least one drug. Once completed, you can submit the list and youll move to Step 3: Select Your Pharmacies. The database will show you pharmacies in your area. You can change the range of miles within your zip code from 1, 5, 6, and 8. The database provides phone numbers for the pharmacies. It is in your best interest to call the pharmacy and make sure they accept your particular Medicare Part D plan before venturing out to fill your prescription."
157,How  Long  Will  It  Take  To  Get  Car  Insurance?,If you have all of the information that is required by your local agent to get you a quote and you have the ability to pay the required downpayment you could have auto insurance coverage within minutes. When you go to see your local agent make certain that you have the vin numbers of the vehicle(s) that you are looking to cover and the driver's license numbers of the person(s) to be covered.
158,What  Is  Medicare  Hospice?,Medicare Hospice is a benefit for those who are terminally ill. Medicare will pay for nearly all the expenses to care for someone at home when they have given up treatment for the illness causing their pending death. Medicare will pay for some medications and treatments that provide comfort.
159,How  Do  You  Determine  Cash  Value  Of  Term  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"The only type of term insurance that has a cash value is ROP Term. This stands for Return of Premium Term. About halfway through the term, it will pay back some cash if you surrender the policy. At the end of the term, it will pay back all the premiums you paid in. Keep in mind that the cash value of ROP term is not able to accessed unless you surrender the policy."
160,Does  Life  Insurance  Pay  For  Your  Funeral?,"Life insurance can be used to pay for your funeral or for any other purpose for which your beneficiary uses it. If you purchase a life insurance to fund your final expenses, leave the death benefit to a beneficiary who knows your wishes, or you can even leave it directly to the funeral home."
161,How  Long  Can  You  Keep  A  Child  On  Your  Health  Insurance?,One of the first changes to come from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) when it was passed in March of 2010 was to extend the period of time that a child could be covered as a dependent under their parent's major medical insurance. Children can be covered under their parent's health plan up to age 26. The child does not have to be dependent uponthe parent and it does not matter if the child is employed and has coverage available through their job or if they are married and could be covered under their spouse's health insurance.
162,When  Is  Health  Insurance  Tax  Deductible?,"Generally a self employed person is able to deduct health insurance if he or she pays the premium. There are other circumstances where health insurance can be deductible, such as a person paying there own premium and is able to file long form itemizing deductions. Tax laws change so be sure to check with your tax adviser."
163,What  Does  Suze  Orman  Say  About  Variable  Annuities?,"Suze has a nice piece online entitled Truth About Annuities. She devotes a lengthy paragraph to variable annuities. She lays out the basics of variable annuities with a slight negative undertone, a disparaging down her nose expose. There are some contentions in her paragraph worth a rousing conversation."
164,Can  I  Pay  Health  Insurance  Premiums  With  Fsa?,"Can you pay health insurance premiums with a Flexible Spending Account? I guess the first thing I would ask is if you have a FSA in place, aren't your premiums already being deducted pre-tax? I don't know of any business situation that offers a FSA plan that doesn't already have employee paid premiums already taken pre-tax. Do you mean health insurance premiums for another family member who is not part of your employer's plan? I believe the answer would be no. FSA in regard to medical, dental and vision expenses are designed to pay towards out of pocket expenses a person has during a plan year."
165,Does  Walmart  Take  Medicare?,"Walmart does accept Medicare Part B. Qualified Medicare recipients can purchase durable medical equipment, medical supplies, and other items covered by Medicare Part B in the Walmart pharmacy area. Walmart also is a participating provider in most Medicare Part D plans, and you can purchase drugs covered under Medicare Part D in a Walmart pharmacy."
166,Can  Auto  Insurance  Be  Transferred?,"Generally, an insurance policy cannot be transferred or assigned. Every personal auto policy I can remember reading prohibits assignment of the policy without the written consent of the insurance carrier. That makes sense because the carrier has a right to choose their customers and since it is their money providing the coverage, they have a right to consider any change of risk. As a general rule it makes more sense for a new policy to be written because even if the carrier consents to the change the new insured inherits the record of that policy including all the claims and payment history. If the coverage is being transferred between a spouse to another spouse after a death, the companies are not in the habit of denying the request to change the first named insured. Otherwise, per the ISO Personal Auto Policy, ""Assignment of this policy will not be valid unless we give our written consent."" The answer is no but there is a pathway to a ""yes"" if the carrier consents in writing."
167,What  Does  SR22  Insurance  Cover?,"An SR22 is nothing more than an administrative trail of the status of your auto insurance coverage. The form is filed because the State licensing agency has determined a need to be aware of the status of your coverage, usually due to failing to have insurance or having committed any of several offenses of driving laws. An SR22 is merely attached to your insurance record and your carrier agrees to submit status updates to your state bureau of motor vehicles. An SR22 does not provide any coverage."
168,Can  I  Get  Car  Insurance  Without  A  Job?,"Yes, as long as you are able to pay your premiums on time. I am not aware of a carrier that asks for a persons employer name or even employment status when they are applying to receive automobile insurance coverage. If you are able to make your insurance premium payments on time the insurance carrier will more than likely provide you coverage for as long as you wish to be provided coverage."
169,How  Often  Do  You  Pay  Health  Insurance?,"That is a great question! As a rule, most insurance premiumpayments are paid on a monthly basis. Some, like your auto or life insurance policies, can also be paid on a quarterly, semi-annual (every six months) or annually. Health insurance though, as a rule is typically a monthly payment, though your provider may also allow for other payment schedules. Thanks for asking!"
170,When  Does  The  Beneficiary  Collect  From  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"The beneficiary collects from a life insurance policy after the insured person dies. You must obtain a certified death certificate, and contact the insurance company or your agent for a death claim. You fill out the death claim and mail it with the death certificate to the address on the form. They will process it and send you a check for the face amount of the life insurance policy."
171,If  I  Don't  Have  Auto  Insurance  Can  I  Rent  A  Car?,"Car rental agencies offer insurance coverage for the duration of the rental period. Check with them as to coverages and premiums. If this is a rare occurrence it might actually make good sense. The good thing about insurance through the rental company when if an accident occurs, their insurance relieves you of further responsibility."
172,Does  Medicare  Pay  For  Ambulance  Rides?,Medicare will cover ambulance transport when your situation is considered medically necessary and any other form of transportation would be a danger to your health. Medicare will only cover the cost of transport to the closest facility that is able to treat your condition. Be aware that non-par providers are allowed to balance bill above the Medicare allowance.
173,When  Is  Home  Warranty  Insurance  Required?,Home Warranty is not required but I highly recommend it. Home Warranty is different from homeowners in that it can cover to fix or replace equipment in your home such as your HVAC Systems or pool equipment. In most cases the warranty company will continue to fix the item before replacing and this process can be extremely time consuming and frustrating. Be sure to research the companies so that you can get a good idea of how they treat these claims
174,Does  Home  Insurance  Cover  Your  Chimney?,"Your chimney is part of your house and there fore is covered for many possible claims including fire. Theft is also included although admittedly, in my 32 years of experience as a premier broker, I have yet to see anyclientreport there chimney missing or stolen. Keep in mind that wear and tear of an aged chimney is not covered."
175,How  Much  Life  Insurance  Do  I  Need?,"Video Transcript: Today's question is, ""How much life insurance do I need?"" Well, you need to take all your financial obligations in indebtedness, all your future obligations like college, retirement, other areas that you think that you want to talk about or even charitable intent. You need to take all those totals, plus the loss of income. Because if I'm not there to generate income, what happens to my spouse or my family? I need to be able to generate income for them to live on. So what I'm looking at, all the ideas of ""How much do I need?"" I want to take all these areas into consideration; financial indebtedness, future obligations, maybe some charitable intent, and to replace the income from the person who's died. Well, that's our consumer question for today. If you have any questions, just submit them to www.insurancelibrary.com."
176,Is  Property  Insurance  The  Same  As  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Homeowners Insurance is a form of Property Insurance. The Insurance Services Office publishes Insurance Forms which are basic coverage contracts sold asinsurance policies by insurance companies. Homeowners Insurance is the most common form of Property Insurance; this form is generally written for Owner Occupied Single Family Homes but in some cases, it could apply to an Owner Occupied Duplex. To complicate matters further, mortgage companies do not differentiate the coverage form; they simply define required insurance as 'Hazard Insurance'; the hazard being the risk or collateral against which the mortgage company has leant funds. If a single family home is owner occupied, a Homeowners Insurance Policy should be purchased; if a 1 - 4 unit dwelling is tenant occupied, a Landlords Insurance Policy should be purchased. For residential apartments with 5+ units, a Commercial Form is required and in many cases can be written as a Residential Apartment Policy under a Business Owners Policy (BOP) package. For further clarification on the correct form of insurance, contact your insurance carrier or our office and we'll be happy to answer any further questions."
177,Is  Life  Insurance  Cheaper  To  Buy  When  You  Are  Younger?,"Yes, life insurance premiums are a lot lower at younger ages when the risk of death is lower. The longer one waits to buy life insurance, the more the premium will be. In a level premium, permanent policy, you are locking in a lower rates for life by buying early."
178,Does  Aflac  Offer  Short  Term  Disability  Insurance?,"Aflac offers short term disability insurance through employer sponsored plans, only. Aflac does not sell individual short term disability plans to individuals. Their short term disability plans must be paid for by worksite premium payroll deduction. There are only a couple of companies that offer individual short term disability insurance. Many more offer individual long term care disability insurance."
179,Does  Long  Term  Disability  Cover  Medical  Insurance?,"Long term disability and medical insurance are two completely different animals. Long term disability replaces a portion of your income during the time you are unable to work at your full time occupation due to a covered accident or illness. Claims payments are made directly to the insured. Medical insurance is designed to pay a portion of the medical bills derived from care you receive from doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. Claims payments are made directly to the providers unless assigned elsewhere."
180,What  Does  Loss  Of  Use  Mean  For  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Often referred to as COVERAGE D, Loss of Use is coverage on your homeowners insurance that covers the cost of losing the use of your home. For example, a fire in your home has caused significant fire & smoke damage, making the house unlivable until repairs are complete. You would need to temporarily move out - maybe to a Residence Inn or hotel. The cost for food, hotel, etc would be covered under loss of use.Most policies have some limit beside COVERAGE D, butif your policy indicates ""ALS"", which is Actual Loss Sustained, this is the broadest coverage."
181,Does  Car  Insurance  Go  On  Your  Credit  Report?,"When you apply to buy insurance, most insurance companies will take your credit into consideration. It is considered a ""soft hit"". It will show up on your credit history that there was an inquiry, it doesn't change or effect your credit. So whatever your credit score was before you apply for insurance is what it will be after applying. To my knowledge, California is one of the states that mandates insurance companies not take a person's credit history into consideration when rating the premium. You can check with an insurance agent or broker licensed in your state to see if your state as the same rules."
182,How  To  Drive  A  New  Car  Home  Without  Insurance?,Do not drive your new car without insurance. If you have a policy in place that covers physical damage you should be automatically covered long enough to call your agent and notify them of the new vehicle. Otherwise you are driving uninsured which is not only breaking the law but risking a potential cost you can not pay. A dealership if they are doing their job will not let you off the lot without first verifying you have an insurance policy in place.
183,Why  Is  Auto  Insurance  So  Expensive  In  Ohio?,"Auto insurance in Ohio is actually fairly inexpensive...if you know where to look. As an experienced broker here in Ohio (just North of Cincinnati), we specialize in finding the lowest available rates offered by the top-rated carriers. Prices are based on many factors including your age, where you live, the type of vehicle you drive and how good (or bad!) your driving record is. Typically, rates here in the Buckeye state are lower than most other states. A younger driver (under 21) will usually pay a higher rate. There are, however, many discounts that can help reduce the premium. Each carrier has a different set of discounts so shopping can make a big difference. Also, by having an experienced broker shop for you, you may be able to find better pricing. Whether its State Farm, Esurance, Progressive, Geico or Farmers (or many others), as experienced brokers with top-rated websites, our job is to help consumers find not only the best prices, but the most appropriate coverage for their specific circumstances."
184,Do  I  Need  Disability  Insurance  In  South  Carolina?,"Yes, if you bring home a paycheck, you need disability insurance in South Carolina. The State of South Carolina does not offer state disability insurance or require that employers offer it. So if you are not getting a group policy through your place of work, it is important to purchase individual disability insurance."
185,Can  an  apartment  complex  require  you  to  add  them  as  a  co-policy  holder  on  your  renter's  insurance?,"The landlord can require that they be named as an additional insured. Most companies do not charge anything for his extension of coverage. It merely clarifies that if someone sues you and the landlord simultaneously that the policy will provide the primary defense. Normally, the concern of the landlord is in the concern over legal action."
186,What  Is  Medicare  Going  To  Cost  Me?,Most people will receive Medicare Part A at no charge. If you have worked in the Social Security system at least 40 quarters you have prepaid for your Part A coverage. Part B is optional (but highly recommended) and current runs $105 per month for most people. Your Part B premium is usually deducted from your Social Security check.
187,Is  Hyoscyamine  Covered  By  Medicare  Part  D?,"Hyoscyamine is a medication used to control symptoms resulting from various GI tract illness and conditions. The drug can be used for for relief of stomach ulcers, IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), colitis and other illnesses. The drug is sold under various brand names including Levsin, Symax, Anaspaz and other names. Check your Part D drug formulary for coverage and benefits."
188,How  Much  Does  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Cost  On  Average?,"The cost of long term care insurance depends upon your gender, age, smoking status, health history, current medical condition and the package benefit package you select. A nonsmoking male and female in good health at age 60 using a joint long term care policy can expect to spend around $300 a month in premium."
189,How  Much  Does  Medicare  Pay  For  IVF?,"IVF, otherwise known as In Vitro Fertilization would generally not be something that medicare would pay for. Typically medicare provides coverage for treatment that is considered medically necessary. Without knowing the details of your particular circumstances and medical requirements it is difficult to answer this type of question definitively. I strongly recommend that you contact medicare directly at 800-Medicare to find a definite answer to this question."
190,What  Is  The  Difference  In  Medicare  And  Medicaid?,"Medicare is a taxpayer financed, government run health insurance program mostly for those age 65 and older. If you qualify for Social Security disability you can also qualify for Medicare. Medicaid is a taxpayer financed, government run health insurance program for low income people. Some qualify under dual rules for Medicare and Medicaid."
191,How  Much  Will  Life  Insurance  Payout?,"In most cases, a life insurance policy will pay out the full death benefit at the insured's death. there could be a few adjustments however. If there is an outstanding loan on the policy, the loan balance will be deducted from the death benefit. This assumes you do not have a ""graded benefit"" policy, which will pay less than the full benefit if death occurs in the first couple of years."
192,Why  Do  You  Need  Disability  Insurance?,"If you were injured in an accident or had a debilitating illness that prevented you from working, how long can you go without a paycheck? How will you pay your bills? How will you pay for your health insurance? Most people do not have enough in savings to pay the bills in the event of an extended illness. If they do, chances are it will come at the expense of the kids college fund or retirement savings."
193,When  Does  Health  Insurance  Become  Mandatory?,"You will have to buy a health insurance plan by January 1st 2014 or pay taxes that are a part of the Affordable Care Act (aka: ObamaCare). In order for guaranteed issue Heath insurance to work, the must require everyone to buy it or else everyone who is healthy would just wait until they were sick to buy it."
194,Does  Getting  Married  Affect  Auto  Insurance?,"Yes, in most cases. Rates for married vs single are different amoungst most companies. How it will affect your rates is unpredictible because it depends on whether or not you were residing in the same household over the last year for starters. In Wisconsin at least if you reside in the same household you must be listed on each others policies if separate insurance is carried. To know exactly how getting married would affect your rates, I would suggest contacting your local agent to discuss it with them."
195,Will  The  Cost  Of  Medicare  Go  Up  In  2014?,"The cost of Medicare will almost certainly go up in 2014. The cost of health care is rising, the population is aging and not getting any healthier. In addition, utilization of medical services continues to rise at a staggering rate. Unless Congress yields to political pressure, you should anticipate your Medicare Part A and Part B deductibles to rise along with your Part B premium. The only remaining question is, how much will these costs rise?"
196,How  Long  Does  Car  Insurance  Last?,"The automobile insurance policy has a start date and expiry date. Claims arising from the operation of the vehicle between those two dates and times are covered. Occasionally a company will reinstate a policy that has passed beyond the expiry date. To do so they will almost always require a statement that there werent any potential claims during the period from the expiry date and the date of reinstatement. In those cases the policy will often be back dated to provide continuous protection. This is important when there is a loss payee, such as a bank, that has the authority to order coverage for the vehicle."
197,Is  AAA  Home  Insurance  Any  Good?,AAA is an A rated insurance provider and offers a good homeowners policy. I always recommend when shopping for homeowners insurance that you do your research and check several companies as there are different policy types with coverage's and exclusions that you will want to look at. An independent insurance agent is an excellent resource who can help you navigate through all the details of policy offerings.
198,Can  I  Keep  Insurance  Money  From  Car  Accident?,"As a general rule you can keep proceeds from your auto insurance. You can also spend that money as you see fit. But most claimants generally use the money to repair their damaged vehicle, replace their totaled vehicle or as a down payment for another vehicle. In recent years auto insurance companies have been issuing good driver checks that that you can use at your discretion."
199,Can  You  Go  To  Jail  For  Having  No  Car  Insurance?,Is it possible to go to jail for nothavingauto insurance. Yes it is possible. Slim but possible. Usually your looking at a hefty fine unless you are either a repeat offender or are involved in an accident or a combination of the two. It is illegal to operate a motor vehicle without insurance.
200,Can  You  Get  Health  Insurance  As  A  Real  Estate  Agent?,"My sick sense of humor almost tempts me to say ""No, real estate agents are specifically excluded from getting health insurance by law"" but I won't do that. Yes, you can get health insurance. What you do for a living has no bearing on your eligibility for health insurance, especially now that ObamaCare is in full effect regarding guaranteed issuance of policies. In my experience, most real estate agents are self-employed/1099 contractor status people and not W2 employees of an agency. So, this probably means that you will need to get individual health insurance either through your state's government health insurance marketplace or outside of it. So, just like you would tell those ""For Sale By Owner"" folks, you need to seek out an experienced health insurance agent who can assist you in obtaining coverage. If you have been without health insurance for more than 60-days and haven't had what is called a ""change of life status event"" (marriage, divorce, childbirth/adoption, loss of other coverage) then you are in a time frame where you would be ineligible for enrollment in true major medical insurance until the next annual open enrollment period begins on November 15th, 2014 and the earliest your coverage could go into effect would be for January 1st, 2015. I hate to be the one to deliver this news but that is how ObamaCare works. Your only coverage option to carry you through until then would be to take out a Short Term Medical insurance plan. There are a variety of short term medical plan options available. However, you need to be aware that short term medical plans do still use limited underwriting questions, can decline a person for coverage and they do not cover pre-existing conditions. Please feel free to contact me if you need advice or assistance in this matter."
201,When  Is  Open  Enrollment  For  Medigap  Policies?,"You can apply for a Medigap plan up to 3 months before your Medicare Part B effective date - you must have both Medicare Part A & Medicare Part B to buy a Medigap plan. Once you have an established Medicare Part B effective date, you will have a 6-month open enrollment period to buy any Medigap plan from any carrier with NO medical underwriting. After this point, you can buy a new Medigap plan whenever you would like (there are no annual enrollment periods for Medigap plans), however, you would have to go through medical underwriting if you don't qualify for a special enrollment period or a guaranteed-issue right. The best overall time to buy will be your initial open enrollment period when you're new to Medicare and just starting Part B coverage. Determining which Medigap plan is right from you and which carrier to apply for the plan through can be a bit more involved than some may realize. It's not all about price as some may believe. You need to look at the carriers' premium rating methods (community, attained, or issue age rated), their rates, their rate increase history, their service history, and other factors. It's best to consult with an experienced Medigap broker who can help you determine which plan and carrier will be most suitable to your desires, needs, and budget. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your Medigap coverage needs, including providing quotes and plan comparisons, and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."

203,Can  An  LLC  Have  A  Retirement  Plan?,"An LLC can have a qualified or non-qualified plan. Most popular qualified plans with employees are defined contribution plans like 401(k)s. If the LLC is a single person perhaps a SEP IRA should be a consideration, with 25% contribution of income with a cap of $51,000 for 2013."
204,How  Much  Would  Car  Insurance  Cost  For  A  Ford  Mustang?,"In order to answer that question an agent would need to know the year, make and model of the Mustang. The coverage's desired. Who is the driver or drivers which would include date of birth and drivers license number. After obtaining this information a quote can be obtained. I don't have to state the obvious but a base model Mustang and a Salene Mustang will have completely different rates. Also a 50 yr old driver vs. a 20 year old driver will have a difference in rate not to mention the driving record."
205,Will  Insurance  Cover  A  Tree  Falling  On  My  Car?,The Comprehensive portion of your policy's physical damage coverage would cover the damage caused to your car by a falling tree provided that the car was parked and stationary at the time.

208,What  Is  Cash  Surrender  Value  In  Life  Insurance?,"Answers above are correct, but thought you might like to know that 1. The column that is usually titled ""Account Value"" is the cash value that is usually used by the carrier to determine the amount of loanable money the policyowner may borrow. 2. When the cash value in the ""surrender value"" column equals the ""Account Value"", it indicates that the surrender period or charges are no longer part of the cash value equation. However, if a loan is still outstanding, the surrender charge period could be over, but the loan would be reflected in a surrender charge lower than the account value."
209,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Garage  Theft?,"If the garage is part of the premise that you rent, you may coverage through your renters policy. Your personal property is covered up to a dollar amount specified within the policies limits.

210,Does  High  Cholesterol  Affect  Life  Insurance  Rates?,The presence of high cholesterol in the blood has been linked to reduced longevity. To the extent that is true your new life insurance policy might be rated. This is to reflect the increased risk that you present to the insurance company.

Term insurance usually has no cash value and jumps way up in price at the end of the term. The latter, ROP Term, will return a portion of the premiums if the policy is cancelled in its later years. If the Insured person is alive when the term ends, 100% of the premiums that were paid in will be paid back to the owner of the policy. Permanent Life Insurance includes Whole Life and several types of Universal Life. These policies have a savings feature in addition to the pure protection, that allows them to stay in effect to a very advanced age. The cash value can also be accessed for other purposes while the Insured person is still alive."
213,Does  State  Farm  Life  Insurance  Test  For  THC?,"Yes, State Farm does offer three types of annuity products at this time (June 27, 2013). The titles and descriptions of these three products are: Future Wealth Builder"" (a flexible premium deferred life annuity), ""Future Income Plus"" (a single premium deferred annuity), and ""Guaranteed Income"" (a single premium immediate annuity)."
214,Where  Can  I  Buy  Health  Insurance  For  An  Individual?,"You can buy health insurance from an experienced broker and their website (perhaps your best option) or the .gov website, where you may talk to a newly-hired and inexperienced worker. It's important to understand all of your options, get a federal subsidy if you deserve it, and speak to an unbiased expert in the field. That's why we can help you best! The Obamacare subsidy is available during Open Enrollment and through specific exceptions. However, there are affordable options available if you miss Open Enrollment."
215,When  Can  You  Disenroll  From  A  Medicare  Advantage  Plan?,It is best to look at the open enrollment period for the smoothest transition. However there may come a time when you just cannot continue to have the coverage and need to make a change. These plans are not intended for members to jump into and out of them but there is always an option to get out and return to a traditional medicare plan. You would have an option of looking into a supplement as well. The best way to deal with this situation is to speak with an agent that understands Medicare and its rules.
216,Does  Life  Insurance  Go  To  Estate?,"If you choose the beneficiary of your life insurance policy to be your estate, or if none of your beneficiaries are alive when you pass, your life insurance proceeds will go to your estate. Other than those circumstances, your policy proceeds go to the person or other entity that you chose to be your beneficiary, bypassing your estate. This allows the benefit to not be tied up in probate and avoids unnecessary fees. However, the value of your life insurance is considered part of your estate value. If the total value of your estate is over the federal or state exempted amount, and if your spouse has passed, estate taxes on the excess may apply."
217,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Rodent  Damage?,"Homeowners insurance excludes damage caused by insects, pests, and vermin. Rodents would be vermin so there would be no coverage for the damage to the dwelling caused by the rodents. Also rodents would not fall under sudden and accidental as the damage vermin cause is over a time period. Time to call the exterminator unless you can find yourself a good cat."
218,When  I  Can  Withdraw  Money  From  My  401K?,"Most people would want to wait until they are at least 59 1/2 years old to withdraw money from their 401k because that is the age when penalty free withdrawals can be taken. You can take withdrawals earlier, but there will be a 10% penalty for early withdrawal. There are exceptions to the 59 1/2 age requirement: You become totally and permanently disabled. You terminate employment through permanent layoff, termination, quitting or taking early retirement in the year you turn 55, or later. Pay for medical care up to the amount allowable as a medical expense deduction in the same year as the medical expense was incurred. Your withdrawal is a response to a qualified domestic relations order. You are required to begin 401k withdrawals by April 1 of the year following the year in which you turn 70 1/2. Regardless of when you take your withdrawal from your 401k, the amount you take out will be taxed as ordinary income for that tax year.

Example ouwl be if you left something on the stove and you caught the building on fire .
220,Does  Medigap  Cover  Eye  Exams?,"Medigap plans do not provide coverage for routine eye exams and eye glasses. In short, you will need to secure coverage under a separate vision insurance plan to to cover routine services. Medicare Part B can provide coverage for some preventive and diagnostic eye exams for people at high-risk of certain conditions (e.g. diagnosing retinopathy in diabetics or mascular degeneration for age-related conditions). In combination with a Medigap plan, these exams can be covered at 100% (Medicare Part B - 80%, Medigap - the remaining 20%). You can check out the medicare.gov website for more specific information regarding condition/risk requirements for Medicare to pay benefits."
221,Where  Is  The  Best  Place  To  Get  Homeowners  Insurance?,"The best to place to purchase insurance is from an agent. If you dont know an agent get a recommendation from a friend, colleague or neighbor. A good agent will listen to you, provide sound financial advice and communicate clearly with you and the insurance company.

In Whole Life, the maturity date coincides with endowment, or the accumulation of cash value to equal the face amount."
223,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Scooters?,"I believe you will find that for the most part, property plicies will exclude any motor powered vehicles from coverage. This is a pretty standard exclusion. Talk to your insurance professional about your options, though. We can easily provide coverage for scooters under a separate contract that is specifically designed to meet those needs at an extremely reasonable price."
224,Will  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Spoiled  Food?,It may. If the food spoilage was caused by a covered loss to your home - such as a power failure. Your food loss may be covered up to the dollar amount specified within the policy possibly less your deductible. Please remember every policy is different. Read your policy completely to understand what coverage it provides and what exclusions it may contain.

The insurance company will repair your home to either its depreciated state or replacement state, depending upon the coverage selected. During the construction any extra living expenses incurred because you cannot live in the home will be a part of the claim. Contact your agent if you have more specific information that you are trying to find."
226,When  You  Quit  Your  Job  Does  Health  Insurance  Stop?,Your employer health insurance plan can stop at any time after you quit your job. It depends on how the plan summary is written. Some plan benefits cease the last day you work. Others continue through the end of the month and some continue for 30 - 90 days. If you exercise your COBRA options you can keep your group plan for up to 18 months in most situations.
227,Can  You  Buy  Car  Insurance  With  A  Suspended  License?,An individual with a suspended license can purchase auto insurance. Generally the intent is so the individual can regain his or her license. The other option is the individual has other members in the household that operate a motor vehicle. If this is the case the owner of the policy can purchase the insurance and exclude themselves as an operator thereby allowing the residents in the household to drive the vehicles. The residents of the household will be required to be added to the policy as operators.
228,Why  Does  Life  Insurance  Cost  More  For  Men?,"Life insurance costs more for men simply because men die sooner than women on average, according to actuarial tables. The difference in rates between men and women is not as much at younger ages and for short term insurance. It is in longer term and permanent policies, and policies purchased at an older age, where the price increases for men show up more. That is because the policy is insuring the male to an older age, and the chances of mortality are higher."
229,What  Is  A  Endowment  Plan  In  Life  Insurance?,"Endowment plans are designed to really push the cash accumulation inside your policy. Why would you want to do that? I mean after all, the purpose of life insurance is to provide the survivor benefit you need, when it is needed, for the best price available. Each dollar of benefit literally costs pennies. It is a great deal. So how does cash fit into this picture? It can be superb icing on the cake. Solid whole life products provide great guarantees on the cash accumulation. Solid whole life companies provide some hefty dividends on a non-guaranteed basics. Universal life can provide not only attractive cash accumulation, but some pretty interesting distribution options. And according to current tax law, all this money can be available with little or no taxation. (Ask your attorney if you dont believe me). BUT certain rules have to be followed if you want to keep Uncle Sam out of the picture. An endowment contract could very well trigger a taxable event. When a policy endows, it could exceed the threshold of growth that the government authorities allow before they tax you. A pretty good sign this has occurred is when the cash value equals the death benefit. Is this necessarily bad? It doesnt have to be. If you get the proper advice from your broker and your tax advisor, this could be a planned event in which you still benefit. Even considering the tax you will have to pay, you could still be way ahead of the game financially. However, if you really want to avoid a taxable event, your insurance company will help you. They really dont want to be sued by you or anybody else who mistakenly gets a tax bill you dont want to pay. They will give you illustrations to your hearts delight with all kinds of red flags screaming endowment! endowment! endowment! You can then plan accordingly. To endow, or not to endow. That is the question :)"
230,How  Much  Does  Life  Insurance  Cost  For  Seniors?,"The cost of life insurance for seniors is much higher than for persons in their 20's and 30's, because the mortality rates for seniors are much higher than for young adults. However, if you are a senior person in good health, or with a very well controlled health condition, there are companies that will cater to you. E.g. Getting type 2 diabetes at age 70 could enable you to still get Preferred rates with a few companies, whereas that would not be likely if you got type 2 diabetes at age 20. If you are a senior in good health and you want more coverage than just for your funeral, it can be worth it to use a medically underwritten policy. But be prepared to have an EKG, answer simple questions to test memory (e.g. who is the president of the US), and have all your medical records reviewed. Using an agency that specializes in senior life insurance can help you jump all the hurdles to get your best rate. For small, no exam final expense policies, the rates for seniors will depend a lot on your age and whether you are male or female. You can expect to pay from $50/mo to $200/mo for a burial policy, on average."
231,When  To  Use  Your  Home  Insurance?,"You can make a claim against your homeowners policy any time that you experience a loss as a result of one of the covered perils. Your policy specifies the circumstances that are covered. Common perils are, fire, and lightning. You should remember that your policy has a deductible. Your policy might have some adjustments based upon being claims free. It is possible to file a small claim and realize very little after the deductible, only to discover that you lost your claims free discount which was much more."
232,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Foundation  Issues?,Unless the issue is caused by a covered peril your homeowners insurance would not pay for any of the repairs to correct the foundation issues. A foundation issue is typically considered a maintainance issue. Please read your policy completely to know what is covered and what exclusions there may be or contact your local agent to have them go over the policy with you.
233,What  Happens  When  I  Cancel  Life  Insurance?,"When you cancel your Life Insurance policy, you are not only giving up the coverage you purchased but you may also be giving up your insurability and cost of insurance. When you applied for the coverage you are considering cancelling, you went through underwriting to determine if you are ""insurable"". While you are insured, if your health was to deteriorate, the insurance company still maintains the coverage you have. If after cancelling your policy, your health starts to suffer, then when you try to reapply for another Life Insurance policy, you may not be insurable and at best you will have to pay more in premium. Plus consider you will be older which also increases your premium. I recommend that you talk to your broker/agent first to discuss your situation and see the alternatives you have."
234,What  Happens  If  I  Cancel  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"If you cancel a life insurance policy, first and foremost, the policy will not pay a death benefit to your beneficiary if/when you pass away. If the policy is Term insurance, there is no cash value to collect and no surrender charge to pay, no matter when you took out your policy. However, if you took it out within the year, your agent may lose all their commission from that sale and could be penalized by the insurance company. With Whole or Universal Life, there will be a surrender charge that reduces the cash value you would collect upon cancelling your policy. However, you may be able to roll your full cash value over into a new policy. Or you may have the option to change your policy to a reduced paid-up policy, in which you get to keep some death protection even though you are no longer paying a premium. Discuss your options with your agent; you may be surprised at the options you have."
235,How  Necessary  Is  Disability  Insurance?,Disability insurance is paycheck insurance. How important is your paycheck? Very important! Disability insurance is an intricate part of defensive financial planning. Most working Americans have 90 days of case reserves for emergencies.

237,How  Can  I  Afford  Health  Insurance?,"The easiest way to afford health insurance is to qualify for the new Obamacare federal subsidy. It's based on household income, and you could receive enough money to pay for most, or possibly all of your premium. An experienced broker (along with our websites) are perhaps the best and most trusted resources to help determine if you qualify for the subsidy, calculate it, and compare the cheapest available healthcare options."
238,What  Will  Renters  Insurance  Not  Cover?,"Like other personal property insurance policies, renters insurance will cover a a rather broad range of possible perils. You will find, however, that in many if not all cases in your state, there are two causes of loss that will be excluded from coverage. The first is damage caused by earth movement, any earth movement. This can include but not be limited to such things as erosion, sink holes and earth quakes. Talk to your insurance professional, however, about having this coverage endorsed onto your policy if you are concerned. The second is damage by Flood. There is no endorsement for this. Flood coverage is only available by purchasing a Flood Insurance policy."
239,When  Does  Life  Insurance  Kick  In?,"This is a good question. Do you mean when the benefits are paid out? For whole life, they build cash value over time that you can borrow against while you are living. Traditional term pays out after death, however there are term policies that pay you back all the premiums after the term is up."
240,What  Is  The  Fine  For  No  Car  Insurance?,The fine for not having car insurance will vary from state to state. Each state sets their own penalties for not having auto insurance. You could find out this information on your states department of motor vehicles website or possibly through your states insurance commissioner website or contact your local police department.

243,Can  An  Illegal  Immigrant  Get  Car  Insurance?,"The short answer is it depends upon the state. One of the most basic principles of insurance is a person/company must have an insurable interest in the property. In order to have an insurable interest in an automobile a person must have a valid drivers license and sometimes a registration. If a state allows an illegal immigrant to obtain a drivers license, then that person can obtain auto insurance. If the person cannot obtain a drivers license from that state, he cannot obtain auto insurance and even being behind wheel is illegal. Political debates aside, an illegal immigrant should find a state where he/she can register for a drivers license and get auto insurance. This not only benefits them because they will get property and liability coverage, but it will also benefit other drivers because it provides them something to recover from in the case of an accident."
244,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Sump  Pumps?,"Not unless they are damaged by a covered peril. At that point they would be consider part of your personal property. Sump pumps breaking down due to age or wear and tear would not becovered Homeowners is not designed as amaintenancepolicy. Covered perils would be things like fire, theft, collapse and other similar occurrences."
245,What  To  Look  For  When  Purchasing  Health  Insurance?,"When purchasing health insurance, it's important to work with an experienced broker (and our websites) so that you know you are only comparing top-rated carriers. Also, the accurate calculation of your federal subsidy is critical, so that you are receiving all of the available federal credits offered by Obamacare. And of course, the premium and benefits should closely align with your budget and healthcare needs."
246,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Groundwater?,"Generally speaking, no. However, it is always important to check with your Insurance Professional about the particular points in your Homeowners policy. Some company's policies may include coverage for damage caused by the failure of a sewer or drainage system. This can include anything from a sump pump to a curtain drain to gutters and downspouts. There would still need to be a determination by a claims professional as to the source of the water."
247,Can  You  Get  Auto  Insurance  Over  The  Phone?,"It is possible to get an auto insurance quote over the phone, but to secure coverage the carrier will more than likely require you to meet with an agent to sign the application and verify that all of the information on the poliy is correct. A will typically not want to cover a vehicle for damage if no one from the company has seen thevehicle to verify its condition."
248,Is  Medicare  Considered  Welfare?,"No, Medicare is not considered welfare. When most people are talking about welfare, they are talking about food stamps, Medicaid, unemployment benefits, housing assistance, child care assistance, etc. Medicare recipients have paid Social Security taxes for at least 10 years in order to receive health care coverage through Medicare."
249,Is  It  Mandatory  To  Apply  For  Medicare  At  65?,"If you are receiving Social Security benefits at age 65, you will be signed up for Medicare Part A and Part B automatically. When you get the packet in the mail, you will have a form that you can use to turn down Part B. At this time you can also opt out of Part A, but it is free and covers very expensive hospitalization costs, so you would be advised to keep it, or have very other good health insurance if you turned it down. If you are not yet receiving Social Security benefits at age 65, it is not mandatory to apply for Medicare Part A or B at that time. However, it is again, advisable to at least get Part A."
250,What  Type  Of  Retirement  Plan  Is  Based  On  A  Formula?,"All group retirement plans that are covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA are based on some formulaic process. This formulaic process is used to ensure against discrimination in the plan. Federal law defines discrimination as a plan that too heavily favors highlight compensated employees. Highly compensated employees are employees who earn over a certain amount in annual income, as of 2013 that amount is $115,000."
251,What  Happens  If  I  Lie  On  A  Life  Insurance  Application?,"Not being truthful on a Life Insurance application could, at the very least, delay the application process, but that would be the least of your concerns. If you lie, as you say, on the application, and if for some reason, that gets through the underwriting process and the policy is issued, then the real conseqence could affect your beneficiary. If you die within the first two years of the policy, and the misinformation is discovered, the company very well could outright deny any claim. Bottom line, don't lie on any insurance application. The odds are with today's modern underwriting technology, you aren't going to get away with it."
252,Can  Life  Insurance  Companies  Check  Medical  Records?,"Yes, absolutely they can. When you fill out an application, you give them permission to check your medical records, and unless your policy is extremely small, they certainly will check those records. That is the only way they can be sure they are not missing a major medical issue you were not frank about. Protect yourself. Be honest and get the coverage you need. If necessary, drop the amount, so long as you have coverage for your family. Thank you. GARY LANE."
253,How  Long  Does  A  DUI  Affect  Life  Insurance?,"This will vary from carrier to carrier. It will also depend on the number of DUI's you've had and your age. Younger people (especially those in their 20's) are effected the most by a DUI on their driving record. For most carriers, one DUI will keep you at their standard risk class for at least 3 years since the incident."
254,What  Does  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Mean?,"Long term care insurance is coverage that pays for personal care needs and other related chronic care services for individuals who are limited in their abilities to perform the activities of daily living (two or more). Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) include eating, bathing, toileting, dressing, moving between a chair and the bed, and remaining continent. The policy typically pays for care that is provided in the individuals home, in an assisted living facility, or in a nursing home. Long term care insurance is available on an individual or a group basis."
255,What  Is  Covered  By  A  Retirement  Plan  At  Work?,"There are employer sponsored qualified plans that may be in place that cover, or more accurately, offer employee participation like a the popular defined contribution plan called a 401(k) under The Employment Retirement Income Security act of 1974 or ERISA. Being covered under a 401(k) may include a employer contribution match."
256,How  Much  Is  Car  Insurance  In  NY?,"Car insurance rates in New York are determined by many variables. Some of the most important factors are your driving record (including other family members), your zip code or county, your age, the type of vehicle you drive, your credit history, how the vehicle is used and the types of coverage you carry. Additionally, the company you are insured with plays a big role in determining the rates. So...how do you get a free quote for car insurance in New York? A reputable nationwide (or New York based) car insurance website will zoom (pun intended) you to your destination. Typically, you can compare the best offers and get expert advice at no cost."
257,Why  Should  You  Have  A  Retirement  Plan?,"Retirement planning is paying yourself. Disciplined despots into a retirement plan from every paycheck, no matter how small can help you develop a habit that you'll appreciate when you retire. You only need to look to the baby boomer generation and their under funded retirement accounts to give you a glimpse into your future. How you save today will determine your lifestyle in retirement."
258,Does  Short  Term  Disability  Insurance  Cover  Maternity?,"In order for a Disability Insurance policy to pay for time off from work due to maternity or childbirth, it must be a Short Term Disability policy. The terms of the policy will depend on which Short Term Disability policy you choose. Keep in mind that you can only purchase this type of coverage before becoming pregnant."
259,When  Does  Health  Insurance  End  When  Leaving  A  Job?,"If you leave your job or are terminated your health insurance usually ends at the end of the month you left your job. At that time you would be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage for 18 months or you could purchase indivdiual health insurance. COBRA used to be the best option if you had a pre-exisitng condition but under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, you can purchase individual coverage with no issues. You have to prove that you have a qualifying event under the IRS code which is a letter of Creditable Coverage from your former health insurance company or employer."
260,Does  Life  Insurance  Get  Taxed  At  Payout?,"The death benefit from life insurance is usually paid out tax free if it is paid directly to the beneficiary(s). If it goes through the estate (no human beneficiary named) it will usually be taxed. If you are planning a larger estate, you will want to involve an estate planning attorney, a life insurance agent and a CPA as your advisory team. There are certain situations where you may be taxed if you do not plan well. A big advantage of whole-life insurance is that you can also use it for tax free income before you die. Life insurance is one of the most tax favorable money management tools you have available."
261,Who  Is  The  Cheapest  Car  Insurance  For  New  Drivers?,"The cheapest car insurance for any driver is the policy that is in force and pays the claim when an accident occurs, regardless of the premium. In California an inexperienced driver is assigned to one of the cars in a household. That makes the premium for that vehicle increase substantially. Avoid the temptation to eliminate or reduce coverages to lower the premium. That could make your auto insurance the most expensive if it will not pay a claim or will not make you whole."
262,What  Does  Medigap  Pay  For?,"Medigap, also known as Medicare supplement insurance, covers a portion of the balance of approved Medicare Part A and Part B expenses. Medigap plans are standardized and assigned letters. All Medigap plans with the same letter are identical in every way, except the premium. Medigap plan F pays 100% of the balance of approved Medicare Part A and Part B expenses."
263,Why  Is  Men's  Car  Insurance  Higher?,"Insurance companies base their pricing on mounds of historical data. They carefully review statistics common to the industry as well as those specific to that company's loss experience. This risk analysis ultimately results in the rates we pay for the products that company offers. Over a great many years, statistics have tended to show that younger less experienced male drivers tend to be involved in more claims than their young, less experienced female counterparts. That being the case, and all other things being equal, it would cost more for a male to insure a car than it would for a female to insure the same car."
264,Can  I  Rent  A  Car  From  Enterprise  Without  Insurance?,If you do not have your own insurance policy to protect you when you rent a car you do have the option to purchase the insurance provided by the rental car company. You must have one or the other as any rental car company will not let you take their vehicle on the road without insurance. Keep in mind the insurance provided by the rental car companies are generally state minimumcoverage's.
265,Can  Car  Insurance  Companies  Drop  You?,"Yes, if you do not pay your premiums or no longer meet the carriers standards the carrier can either cancel or non-renew your policy typically with as least fourteen days notice. Contact your local agent to discuss the details of the drop notice. They may be able to help you understand the reasons behind your coverage being dropped or non-renewed."
266,What  Is  Long  Term  Health  Insurance?,"I am going to take a stab at this as I am not quite sure what the question is. Health Insurance is not necessarily long term unless you have it for a long time however you may switch between different plans. If you are asking what is Long-Term Care Insurance then I will also answer this: Long-Term Care provides a benefit when you have chronic illness needs. Pays for Nursing Home & Care programs, assisted living situations, in-home support and more."
267,Is  Homeowners  Insurance  Increasing?,"That is a great question! Unfortunately, they probably are. The price for homeowners depends in part upon the cost of building and repairing homes near you, so as construction costs rise, so do premiums. The price can also rise if a number of claims have been filed near you, and if the company is trying to recapture lost profits. Your best bet is to contact a local agent who can help you compare prices, and see if there is one that might be more affordable. You can always gamble and raise your deductible also. Thank you for asking!"
268,What  Is  A  Retirement  Plan  Fiduciary?,"Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 requires employer sponsored plans to accept fiduciary responsibilities for compliance under 404c and the newest regulation for fee disclosure, 408(b)(2). ERISA requires employers to design a written plan, a trust fund to hold the assets, an accounting system for the retirement plan and written notifications and updates to plan participants."
269,How  To  Withdraw  Cash  Value  From  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"First be sure you have a cash value life insurance policy. For example a whole life, universal life, indexed universal life or variable life, but not a term life which has no cash value. Locate in your policy the illustrations page. Depending on the years of accumulation you will see the cash value of the policy. You may ""borrow"" against the cash value at a very low interest rate and keep your coverage in force. Or you may cancel your coverage and receive the full cash value amount which is income tax free in most cases. Simply, call the insurance company and ask for the proper form to be sent to you in order to execute the transaction. However, before doing the later, be sure to have alternative coverage in place unless you are fortunate enough not to have a need for life insurance in the future."
270,What  Is  Retirement  Survivors  And  Disability  Insurance?,"Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance is a reference to three of the benefits that Social Security pays to those who have paid into Social Security taxes. The ""retirement"" part refers to Social Security income that people get when they retire. the ""survivors"" part refers to the Social Security income benefits paid to dependents of a qualified deceased person. And the ""disability"" part refers to Social Security Disability benefits disabled persons receive if they are qualified."
271,What  Is  The  Exclusion  Ratio  In  Annuities?,"The exclusion ratio usually refers to taxation of the payments or proceeds. What they do is take what you paid in, divided by what you are paid out. This will come up with a percentage ratio. This ratio will be applied to the funds paid to you and that portion of the funds would be 'excluded' from taxation. Consult with a tax professional to see how this may apply to your individual situation."
272,What  Does  Disability  Insurance  Mean?,"Disability insurance is just that! It covers you should you be unable to perform your job due to an accident or illness. Some companies consider disability to include ""any occupation"" while others consider disability to mean that you are unable to perform the duties of your own occupation. When selecting a disability plan make sure you choose ""own occupation"" over ""any occupation."""
273,Can  An  Annuity  Be  Rolled  Into  A  401K?,"If youre addressing existing non-qualified annuity and you desire to use in funding an 401(k), the following cautions are advised. Your name may be the same on the annuity as well as the IRA, but it reality, your changing ownership registration. If that happens your annuity, if effect, is being surrendered and that surrender will trigger an ordinary income tax event on the gain in the policy. If youre under age 59 an additional 10% penalty will be assessed as well. And dont forget non-qualified annuity basis is tax free, by inserting it into an IRA; you give up the tax free status of basis because all IRA distributions are an ordinary income tax event. Before moving forward with any changes consult a tax advisor or CPA."
274,Can  You  Claim  A  Breast  Reduction  On  Medicare?,"The answer to your question is going to depend on if it is ""cosmetic surgery"" or is it medically necessary. Medicare and all health insurance policies have strict regulations about paying for ""cosmetic surgery"" and then what happens if you have complications from the suregery? I would recommend you rule out ""cosmetic surgery"" because once the invasion is made it exposes you to all the possiblities of infection or other complications. You can go to WEBSITELINK and type the procedure into the inquiry window and see what medicare says"
275,Will  My  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  A  Leaky  Roof?,"The damage caused as the result of a leaky roof is probably covered. The damage to the roof would be covered if caused by a named peril. If the roof leak is covered it will be covered as a depreciated item by most insurance companies, rather than replacement. It is important to stop the leak as quickly as possible regardless of whether there is coverage or not. The damage to a house by water can be quite severe."
276,When  Does  Medicare  Cover  Blood  Tests?,"Medicare Part B covers most lab tests as long as they are medically necessary. Routine blood work in conjunction with your annual preventive care exam is usually covered at no charge to you. If your lab tests are diagnostic in nature, and considered medically necessary, they should be covered subject to the deductible and coinsurance."
277,Can  Life  Insurance  Companies  Access  Medical  Records?,"Yes, life insurance companies access medical records with your permission. Depending on the size of the policy and company requirements, medical records may or may not be required for your policy. When you apply for life insurance, there is a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), which provides permission for the insurance company to obtain and view your medical records. The medical records, along with a prescription check, MVR records, and exam are used to determine your eligibility for life insurance."
278,How  Much  Is  Term  Life  Insurance  For  20  Years?,"There's many factors that go into the premiums for life insurance to say what a policy costs - it will be different for every person as we each have our own specific needs. The premium for a policy will depend on the insured's age, amount of coverage they want, how long they want the coverage for (in this case, 20 year term insurance), their riskclassification (determined by your medical history), and whether they'reapplying with full underwriting or non-medical term coverage. The risk classification is the MOST critical factor in determining the cost (premium) of a life insurance policy. The risk class depends ona number of factors including whether you're male or female, your medical history, height/weight profile, any tobacco usage, and other factors. Please keep in mind - every carrier has their own set of underwriting guidelines and mortality tables, and each may offer a different risk class for a given medical profile - e.g. company A may offer preferred (featuring lower rates) and company B may only offer standard (featuring higher rates). Non-medical term life insurance policies will almost always cost much more than fully underwritten policies that require an exam because an insurance company is taking on more risk without having a full medical picture of you. Consult with an experienced life insurance broker to determine what coverage is appropriate/suitable for your needs and budget. Please feel free to contact me for help or if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
279,What  Is  The  Term  Of  Life  Insurance?,"If you actually buy Term Life Insurance, you get to pick the term, be it one year, five years, ten years, or even twenty years. But you need to pay the premium every year, or it will end. 97% of folks do not continue to pay and it ends for them. They then have to get another policy, only to find it costs more because they are older, or is not even available because of their health. A man in his 30's put off buying until last week, only to find he had developed MS and had to pay a much higher premium. He was lucky to be able to get insurance at all. Do not put off buying insurance. Something is always better than nothing. Getting Permanent Whole Life Insurance is the safest. The rates never go up and you can keep it your entire life, so long as the premiums are paid. A quality agent can help you determine what you can afford, and how to arrange a variety of possible alternative options. Gary Lane, Agent for New York Life, 949 797 2424. Thank you."
280,What  Is  An  Annual  Premium  For  Home  Insurance?,"Great question. If you are asking what is...the cost...for a homeowner's policy, this may help you. Home policies are rated based on age of home, type of construction, occupancy and location. In my state, Florida, the distance to water is very important as well as the type of roof. There are two styles, gabled roofs (which are popular in the Northern States) and hip roof (which is a newer style and has better resistance to wind. (We have hurricanes here.)"
281,What  Kind  Of  Life  Insurance  Should  I  Buy?,"There are many choices of life insurance available to you. The main stream life insurance products are term life, universal life, variable life and whole life. Each one has a specific purpose. Term life insurance is meant to coverage a specific period of time. The common terms are 1-5-10-15-20-25-30-35 years. This means the rate or premium you purchase is guaranteed level for that period of time regardless of change in health, life style or occupation. Term life is commonly used for younger people starting out in life, covering a large debt, life a mortgage on a home or business debt, or covering for a young child's education. term life insurance allows for the largest face amount for the smallest premium payments. Universal life and variable life are permanent life insurance solutions that build cash value. Typically the premiums are more expensive and the face amounts are less because part of the premium is going into a cash value fund that can be invested with numerous options. The cash value can later be used for retirement, college funds, critical or chronic illness or even to purchase a large asset like a home. The universal and variable options are typically more aggressive with the cash value funds. The last option, whole life insurance, is very similar to the previous universal life insurance options. However, the cash value funds are typically a fixed percentage of growth. Whole life as it's name suggests is primarily meant to cover you for your entire life. I recommend using an experienced independent life insurance broker with numerous carriers to shop the market and find you the best product at the best price for your unique situation. Good luck."
282,Is  Xarelto  Covered  By  Medicare?,"In most cases, Medicare does not cover medications unless you are hospitalized. To have coverage for your outpatient medical needs, you would need to purchase a Part D prescription drug plan. Each company offering this type of coverage has their own, unique formulary list of medications they consider to be covered expenses. It is always best to consult with an independent agent that represents many different companies to assist you in finding the absolute best coverage for your personal situation."
283,I  Was  Fired  When  Does  My  Health  Insurance  Stop?,"It depends. In some cases your coverage stops the last day you were actively at work. In other cases, coverage continues to the end of the month or it may continue through the end of the following month. In most cases you will be eligible for COBRA and continue for up to 18 months."
284,How  Does  Split  Dollar  Life  Insurance  Work?,"Split dollar arrangements can vary between a corporation and it's key executives, the grantor of an estate and it's associated irrecoverable life insurance trust or two parties that share an insurable interest. It is a sharing arrangement between two entities of death benefit and cash values of a life insurance policy."
285,Is  It  Ok  To  Cancel  Life  Insurance?,"That is truly up to the policy owner. If you are purchasing a new policy that is providing for your coverage needs better than the current policy then it may. In most cases though depending on the amount of time that the life insurance policy has been in effect, it is not recommended to cancel a life insurance policy unless it is absolutely necessary. All licensed agent are ethically obligated to provide information that helps the proposed client make a decision that is in their best interest not that of the agent."
286,Who  Should  Be  Beneficiary  On  Life  Insurance?,"It depends on the reason for the policy. Most people will select a spouse, parent or other family member. If the policy is for final expenses you can name the person who will be handling those affairs or even the funeral home. I do not recommend naming a child as beneficiary unless the money is earmarked for the child after he or she turns 18. Money left to the child will be held in trust until the child is of legal age."
287,Can  You  Be  Dropped  From  Group  Health  Insurance?,"Yes, but not just because someone in the front office feels like picking on you that day. There would have to be some change in your eligibility status or what the company's policy is to trigger such an event. For example, you had your working hours reduced below 30 hours per week and this puts you below both your employer's and the Federal government's definition of what a full-time eligible employee is (30 or more hours per week defines a person as full-time for benefits eligibility under ObamaCare). This could trigger your still being an employee but no longer being eligible for their group health insurance plan. If you are responsible for paying a portion of your health insurance premium (and most employees are these days) and for some reason you are unable to pay your share of the premium (usually hard to do since these payments are generally taken out on a payroll deduction basis) then you could be terminated for non-payment of premium. Of course, if your employer decides to terminate their group health insurance plan entirely and you are dropped from coverage because a group plan no longer exists at your workplace you are obviously dropped. Though usually even small employers will try to give advance notice and employers (especially larger ones) are required to give a certain amount of advance notice of a plan change or termination. But you can't be dropped from your employer's coverage in an arbitrary manner while still an employee meeting all the eligibility requirements set forth under your employer's personnel policies and state and Federal laws. For example, you couldn't be terminated from the health insurance plan simply because your were running up a lot of expenses for your cancer treatment."
288,Does  Life  Insurance  Cover  Cancer?,"Life insurance pays a death benefit regardless of the cause of death, including cancer. Some policies include an acceleratd death benefit that allows you to access a portion of the death proceeds if you have a terminal condition. In most cases death must be expected to occur withing 2 years of taking out the ""loan""."
289,What  Is  Supplemental  Long  Term  Disability  Insurance?,"A supplemental disability insurance is a personally owned long term disability policy usually purchased to supplement a group employer sponsored long term disability plan. You are basically ""supplementing"" your existing group plan with a personally owned policy. The reason this is necessary is because most group plans only cover 50- 60% of an employees income. A supplemental policy will provide additional coverage in addition to the group plan. The amount of supplemental disability coverage you can purchase is limited based on the insurance carriers guidelines. This is determined by the amount of your income your group plan covers and weather or not you pay for your group plan or your company does. As a general rule, most carriers won't let you insure more than 70% of your gross annual income."
290,Can  Married  Children  stay  On  Parents  Auto  Insurance?,"Generally married children cannot be on the parents policy. What happens if you try to hide this ""material fact"" and you have an accident and now you need to file a claim? Usually if you are on your ""parents"" policy the parent is the ""primary"" driver and you are a child that just drives your parents car sporadically. If you or your spouse have a vehicle and you have the car financed in your name and your parents are not on the note-can you say Red Flag?"
291,Can  You  Claim  Medicare  And  Private  Health?,"You can have Medicare and private health insurance, depending on the type of other insurance you have. You can have Medicare and a cancer plan, or hospital indemnity plan, or other ancillary form of coverage. You can have Medicare and employer group health insurance, or retiree group health. Consult an adviser."
292,What  Is  A  Life  Insurance  Annuity?,"An annuity issued by a life insurance company is an income for life. That said, there are numerous ways that income can be taken. For example, immediate annuities as their name implies start when funds are deposited with the insurance company. Deferred annuities start at some future date, say on retirement for example. Annuities can also be designed to last for one annuitant's lifetime at a fixed amount, or for a guaranteed number of years. These are just a few of the options that are available. To learn about what's best for you, speak to an independent agent familiar with many carriers and their choices."
293,What  Can  I  Expect  To  Pay  For  Disability  Insurance?,"Disability premium pricing depends on your medical information, behaviors and your compensation. Medical information is collected such as gender, age, smoking status, health history, current medical condition, etc. Behaviors like dangerous recreational activities, hazardous vocations and motor vehicle violations. And how much of your compensation do you want to coverage within the limits of disability insurance? The generally rule of thumb for a nonsmoking healthy person covering 60% of their compensation can be 3 to 5% of the compensation coverage."
294,What  Is  Mutual  Whole  Life  Insurance?,"A mutual life insurance company is owned by their policy holders who select a board of directors, generally by a proxy vote to operate the company on their behalf. Every year the board of directors generally declares a dividend which in turn is distributed pro rata to their policy holders."
295,What  Is  A  Pension  Plan  Sponsor?,"As an example, under ERISA (Employees Retirement Income Security Account) of 1974, employers can sponsored defined benefit and/or contributions. They usually outsource the money management to a third parties. Some employer sponsors also match some portion of the employee's annual contribution. They're also responsible for the compliance under qualified plan regulations."
296,What  States  Have  State  Disability  Insurance?,"The states that either mandate or carry state disability insurance are New York, Rhode Island, California, New Jersey, Hawaii, and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Of these, only California directly offers purchase of disability insurance from the state. An SDI tax that is charged to employees is what funds it."
297,What  Is  Covered  By  Long  Term  Disability  Insurance?,"The short answer to what is covered by long term disability insurance is a percentage of your income. This benefit money can be used for anything you choose. Typically it is used to cover your daily living expenses while out of work, but can be used for items not covered by your health insurance such as a wheel chair ramp."
298,Can  You  Switch  Home  Insurance?,Great Question. It is normal to switch your home insurance if you can get a better rate and coverage from another insurance company. You must inform your mortgage if you have a mortgage on your property. Make sure your new policy will cover the important things to you in your home.
299,Who  To  Buy  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  From?,"It is a good idea to buy Long Term Care Insurance from a broker that carries multiple companies, or an agency that uses an LTCI broker (like ours does). That way you can be sure you are getting the most competitive rate, and will have the expertise of an agent that knows what you will qualify for. They can also guide you to the most important features, so that you can get the ones you need but not overspend for options that do not add much value."
300,Does  Medicare  Cover  Zostavax?,"Zostavax is the shingles prevention vaccine. Medicare Part B does not cover the Zostavax vaccine, but all Medicare Part D plans to cover this vaccine. The amount you have to pay depends on your plan. It is usually cheaper to go to a pharmacy to have the injection that to have the injection at a doctor's office."
301,Is  Aflac  Cancer  Insurance  Worth  It?,"It does not matter if it is AFLAC or any other company, in my opinion Cancer insurance is a good buy. Even if a person has health insurance, the cost of Cancer can devastate a persons financial well being. With deductibles, copay's, travel, loss of income, and cost of alternative treatments, Cancer Insurance can make a difference between getting better care or going bankrupt."
302,Can  You  Switch  Car  Insurance  Mid  Policy?,"Insurance policies can be cancelled. Many companies charge you for the number of days that you were covered. Some use another system that penalizes you a bit for cancelling before the end of the term. All you need to do is notify the company or your agent. All coverage ceases. This should not be done unless you no longer have the vehicle, or you are immediately placing insurance coverage with another company."
303,My  Claim  Was  Denied  Due  To  My  Criminal  Record.  Is  That  Right?,"You are not required to accept the decision of the claims adjuster. The company does not have to pay if fraud is involved. Normally, this would go beyond suspicion or implication. Many companies have separate units to investigate fraud. These companies will often refer their files to criminal prosecutors."
304,Does  Life  Insurance  Go  On  Your  W2?,"According to www.irs.gov, $50,000 or less of group-term life insurance that is carried directly or indirectly by the employer (meaning the employer pays for some or all of the life insurance for employees OR arranges for the premiums paid by at least one employee to subsidize the premium for at least one other employee), does not have any tax consequences. Life insurance coverage over $50,000 that is carried directly or indirectly by the employer, will include on the W2 the amount of the premiums that is taxable to the employee. A policy that is not carried directly or indirectly by the employer has no tax consequences to the employee."
305,Can  Nursing  Home  Take  Life  Insurance?,"If you are going through a Medicaid spend down, the nursing home can take the cash value in your life insurance policy down to an amount that will leave you with the allowable amount of assets. You have the right to purchase a final expense policy or a burial policy, so it may be possible that your life insurance policy can be designated as this permitted final expense policy."
306,When  Are  Life  Insurance  Proceeds  Taxed?,"In most cases, life insurance proceeds, the death benefit, are received income tax free by the beneficiary in most cases. This is a key feature of life insurance. Common exceptions include business-owned life insurance issued, or materially modified, after August 17, 2006 which may be taxable unless specific steps are taken during time of application and annually thereafter to meet conditions which allow the proceeds to be income tax-free. Another exception is a tax trap where life insurance contracts with three parties involved may also have unexpected taxable implications."
307,Is  Accidental  Life  Insurance  Worth  It?,"Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) and accidental death benefit (ADB), either as a stand alone policy or as a rider on a life insurance policy, is inexpensive but I question its value. In some instances, it may make sense to the buyer. I don't follow industry sales data at this granular a level but I can safely say that it is neither offered nor sold as much as it was in the past when our economy was more industrial and agrarian than service oriented the way it is today."
308,Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  A  Tummy  Tuck?,A tummy tuck will be covered under your health insurance plan as long as it is considered (and coded) as medically necessary by your attending physician. Often times this is considered an elective procedure and won't be covered. It's vital to contact your carrier prior to the procedure to find out how (if at all) they will cover the surgery. The best place to start is to call the benefits verification or pre-certification phone number on the back of your insurance cards.
309,Does  Health  Insurance  Typically  Cover  Otoplasty?,"Health insurance may cover otoplasty, although in most cases it does not. If it is considered cosmetic (and usually it is), it may not be paid or covered under a typical policy. However, all plans are different and you should always check with your carrier and inquire about benefits. If it is not for cosmetic reasons, that will help your chances."
310,Is  Life  Insurance  Part  Of  An  Estate  After  Death?,"The are many varying circumstances for lifeinsuranceproceeds. Life insurance is paid directly to the benefactresses of the life insurance policy. Generally most married couples use the marital deduction act to pass the proceeds and all other assets to the surviving spouse. If the proceeds remain with the surviving spouse, they are subject to federal and state estate taxation if the proceeds and all other assets exceed the federal unified credit and the state exemptions.If that possibility exists, then the policy or policies should be owned day one by an Irrecoverable Life Insurance Trust to avoid inclusion in the estate."
311,When  Do  You  Get  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"The time to get DI is different for everyone depending on your occupation and health. The best answer is ... as soon as possible. DI is cheaper the younger you are, plus you never know if you might become sick or injured. If you're worried that you might make more money in the future, you can add a rider on your policy that will make you eligible for more coverage at a later date, or you can simply try to buy more DI when the time comes (assuming you don't have any serious medical issues when that time does come)."
312,How  Do  I  Know  What  Health  Insurance  I  Have?,"Your policy provides your health plan information - it'll tell you the carrier name, your policy number, plan details including premiums, copayments, coinsurance, deductible, maximum out-of-pocket expense. If you're unsure of what you have exactly, you can always contact your health insurance agent to get more information. If you're looking for new coverage, I always recommend consulting with an experienced broker to make sure that what you have provides good coverage and meets your needs and budget. Experienced brokers will have an in-depth knowledge of products from multiple carriers, can review a wide range of options with you, and help you determine which program will best serve your needs. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
313,What  Is  The  Average  Salary  Of  A  Life  Insurance  Agent?,"That's a great question! An insurance agent most often works off of a payment that is made to them when they sell a policy or product for the company - called a commission. These commissions can be fairly sizable, or very small, depending upon the sale. Therefore, in most cases, the earnings of the insurance agent depend entirely upon their ability to sell, and the product commission that is paid upon the sale. I believe the vast majority of agents will tailor the right product to the needs of the client, but there will unfortunately always be a few that are more interested in commission than client. You are always wise to have an idea of what it is that you want, and if you feel pressured, to ask for time to think it over. Follow your instincts. If you were considering a career as an agent, be aware that the start up period can be really lean until you've gotten your client base built, and you may need to have another source of income, especially if you were accustomed to a steady paycheck. Once you get rolling, if you are motivated, honest, and good with your clients, you can make a very comfortable living. Anything I can do to help, I'm happy to - feel free to contact me. Thanks for asking!"
314,Who  Invented  Critical  Illness  Insurance?,"Critical Illness Insurance covers specified major illnesses. Typically, it pays a lump sum (sometimes different) payment to the insured. The first Critical Illness policy was issued in 1983 in South Africa. They have grown in popularity since that time. A full-time broker (not a part-timer, a media person or someone not fully-licensed) will be your best resource for quotes and information."
315,Does  Great  Clips  Offer  Health  Insurance?,"Since most of their locations are franchised, it would depend on the franchise owner. Typically, if coverage is offered, it may not be paid in full by the owner. But most importantly, can you get a good haircut at Great Clips? It's just my opinion, but my answer would be Yes!"
316,Is  Krystexxa  Covered  By  Medicare?,"Krystexxa is a medication used to treat gout and can be effective when other treatments have not produced the desired results. FDA approval for Krystexxa was granted in 2010. In 2011 Medicare assigned a treatment code to Krystexxa. Krystexxa is infusion therapy, covered under Medicare Part B. Due to the cost ($60,000 per year) there may be limits placed on how many treatments will be approved by Medicare."
317,What  Is  The  Right  Amount  Of  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Talk tot your insurance professional and ask for a current ""Reconstruction Analysis"" for your home. Be sure to detail any improvements or renovations that you may have made so that these can be properly factored into the calculation. The result of this analysis, if completed properly, will be an accurate measure of what it would cost to reconstruct your home as it is today, should it be severely damaged or lost due to a covered peril. Once this figure is determined, be sure to ask if the policy includes a form or ""replacement Guarantee"" to make sure that moving forward you will remain properly covered."
318,How  Much  Is  Car  Insurance  For  A  17  Year  Old  Female  In  California?,"In California the sex of the driver does not play a role in the price of car insurance. The year make and model of the car are important, as is the annual mileage of the vehicle. The driving record of every driver in the household is very important and the years of experience as a driver are also very important. These factors illustrate that the rating is complex and you should meet with a trusted insurance agent to guide you through the process."
319,Does  Medicare  Cover  Xanax?,"Xanax is a prescription drug used most often to treat anxiety. Some Medicare Part D will cover at least a portion of the cost of Xanax. In evaluating prescription drug plans, including those coupled with a Medicare Advantage plan, make sure you run all your medications through the Medicare drug formulary finder."
320,How  Much  Does  Life  Insurance  Usually  Cost?,"There are so many factors in pricing your lifeinsurance, it's impossible to estimate the cost. How much do you need? How long do you need it? What gender are you? Are you smoker? Are you healthy? Is your family health historygood? Do you have dangerous recreational activities? Is your motor vehicle record clean? Do you have substance abuse problems with drugs oralcohol? Do you have a felony? Is your credit good? Just to name a few of the factors that enter into the price tag of lifeinsurance."
321,Should  I  Buy  Life  Insurance  When  I  Am  Young?,"Life insurance is always cheapest now. The exception would be a smoker who quits, then applies a year later. Of course going without insurance for that year carries the risk of dying during that time without providing for yourfinal expenses, or thefinancial needs of loved ones. Do it now."
322,How  To  Choose  Medigap  Insurance?,"The best way to choose a Medigap Policy is by working with a licensed independent agent who specializes in Medicare Supplement insurance. We work closely with you to make sure you understand the benefits associated with each Medigap Plan. All Medigap Plan benefits are standardized, so if you want the benefits of Plan F, it's the same exact coverage with every insurance company. The only difference is the price. An independent agent who specializes in Medicare Supplement insurance can work with you to make sure you get the benefits you desire. We shop the insurance market to find the best priced premium. This is a great option as opposed to calling or applying online to an insurance company. Often they are the companies with the higher premiums. It's always in your best interest to start off with the lowest premium for the Medigap plan you want since premiums do increase over time. Thank you for reading my response. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance."
323,What  Kind  Of  Health  Insurance  Is  Best?,"The best type of health insurance really depends on your circumstances. For example, generally healthy individuals with additional cash on hand are often best suited by High Deductible Health Insurance Plans as they can cover the high deductible if in the rare chance they should require considerable health care. The deductible acts as a stop loss against their total risk of expense exposure. Individuals with less cash on hand, and or those with medical conditions that require more frequent trips to the doctor are generally better suited by Managed Health Care systems like Heath Maintenance Organizations or Preferred Provider Organizations with low deductibles and/or co-pays."
324,Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  STD  Testing?,"Coverage for testing/screening for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has been standard practice in the group and individual health insurance marketplaces for many years. What is covered and how may have varied from state to state. Under the requirements of ObamaCare, health insurance policies compliant with that law will have to cover testing for HIV and a variety of other STDs. So, certainly, policies purchased on or after January 1, 2014 should offer rather extensive coverage for STD testing and in most cases one would expect testing/screening to be covered under the preventive care requirements of ObamaCare which means 100% coverage with no copays, deductibles or co-insurance cost sharing. Testing done for treatment purposes and monitoring after an initial diagnosis has been made are then subject to the plan's treatment coverage provisions. So, the very same test done at no charge to diagnose an STD may be subject to a copay, deductible and/or co-insurance when done in conjunction with chronic disease management/treatment."
325,What  Are  Immediate  Annuities?,"When you look into an Annuity you have a variety of ways to fund it. You can make monthly payments, you can make a lump sum payment and you can make lump sum to start off and add to it. In an Immediate Annuity you can make a lump sum payment, annuitize it and begin to receive monthly payments. People who want to have a steady monthly payment tend to utilize this type of annuity so they can get regular payments from the insurer."
326,What  Does  A  Health  Insurance  Premium  Mean?,"This is the term used to describe the monthly obligation you pay to have the policy. Think of it in terms of ""payment"". Premiums will vary on a policy depending on the type of policy it is, the deductible, the co payment, whether you have dental or vision, etc. Most people keep policies longer the more affordable a monthly premium is to their budget."
327,What  Happens  To  People  With  Cancer  And  No  Insurance?,"Since you are asking this in the critical illness section I will assume you have health insurance. Your major medical health insurance plan will pay the bulk of your medical bills but you will still be personally responsible for your out of pocket costs including copay's, deductibles, coinsurance and so forth."
328,When  Does  Mandated  Health  Insurance  Start?,Mandated insurance starts October 1st 2013 when Exchanges begin to operate.Insurance policies purchase on the exchange wont be effective until January 2014.Most or all Health Insurance Companies are already selling plans that meet parts of the mandate that is already in effect. Large business part of the mandate will have another to implement 2014.
329,What  Does  Renters  Insurance  Protect?,"Renters insurance will provide protection for your personal property, personal liability, and loss of use up to the policy levels possibly subject to a policy deductible. If you have renters insurance and your rented premise is damaged by fire, smoke, or lightning (to name some of the covered perils). Remember every policy is different. Please read your policy completely to understand the coverage provided and any exclusions that there may be or contact your local agent to have them go over the policy with you."
330,Why  Annuities  Are  Poor  Investments?,"Tax deferred annuities are insurance products with differing crediting methods for a diverse saving and/or investment strategy for a suitable purchaser who demonstrate a high tax bracket and mid to long term hold horizon. This is determined by developing a personal financial profile that includes risk assessment, a retirement date and a life expectancy report."
331,Does  medicare  limit  the  number  of  echocardiograms  one  can  have  in  any  given  amount  of  time?,"Medicare will cover an echocardiogram if your doctor orders it for diagnostic purposes. An Echo is covered under Medicare Part B. Medicare will pay for about 80% of the costs after the Part B deductible is met ($147 in 2014) - you would be responsible for the other 20% and the Part B deductible. When you first enroll in Medicare Part B, you open your 6-month initial open enrollment period to buy a Medicare supplement plan (a.k.a. Medigap plan) with NO MEDICAL UNDERWRITING!. A Medigap plan can cover the deductibles and a portion or all of the other 20% of expenses covered by Part B and features a number of other big advantages as well. An experienced Medigap broker can help find the Medigap plan and carrier that's most suitable for you and your budget. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
332,How  To  Determine  Term  Life  Insurance  Amount?,"Many life insurance experts recommend about 6 to 8 times your annual salary for the amount of term life insurance that you may need; however, the figure will depend on your financial needs and goals. You have to factor in that mortgage, education expenses for children...basically whatever your family will need to survive and thrive when you're gone. Of course, since term life insurance is for a specific period of time, you will need to calculate how long you need this certain amount of money as well."
333,Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  Glaucoma?,Glaucoma is a serious illness that can lead to permanent blindness if not treated. Glaucoma is easily treated in most patients and can be controlled with prescription eye drops. In some cases glaucoma cannot be successfully treated with eye drops and surgery is required. Either conventional blade surgery or laser surgery may be needed to treat the condition. Most major medical health insurance plans will cover glaucoma treatment.
334,What  Does  Disability  Insurance  Protect?,"Disability Insurance protects your paycheck. Only people who draw an income can purchase Disability Insurance, and the benefit you can get is based on your income. If you were injured and unable to go to work, or got an illness that caused you to be off of work, or had complications in childbirth that kept you from going back to work as planned, Disability Insurance will pay a large % of your paycheck to you in cash each week. You can use this money just as you would have used the paycheck you earned through your job. So in essence, DI also protects your family, your home, and your lifestyle."
335,Should  Car  Insurance  Increase  Every  Year?,"If the cost of auto repairs hasnt increased and damages awarded in lawsuits hasnt increased, auto insurance probably shouldnt increase. Your state insurance commissioner keeps a close eye on insurance cost in your states. He does this for two reasons. The first is to make sure that the public isnt being charged too much and the second is to make sure that the insurance companies are taking in sufficient money to honor all of the promises that they have made. The real cost of automobile insurance is determined when you have a claim. If the policy limit is exceeded and angry people are suing you, you paid too much for your insurance. If your policy had high limits and took care of everything, then you bought cheap insurance. Having to settle a claim out of your own pocket is the most expensive form of insurance that you can purchase. The reason that insurance premiums increase is that the company pays out more than it can afford to pay out. It is a simple balance sheet calculation. When the company finds that they are paying out more in claims than they are receiving in premiums they file with the state insurance commissioner to review and adjust rates in your state. Several things cause the claims experience of a company to increase. It could be that the frequency of claims increases. This could be the result of reduced safety enforcement, poorer road conditions or a variety of other causes. It could be that the severity of claims has increased. This would be the result of an increasing number of accidents turning into lawsuits. It also could be caused by juries making increasingly high awards to those injured in accidents. It also could be the result of increased medical costs in your area. Another factor could be the cost of auto repairs. Materials and parts tend to become more expensive over time and this could affect the claims experience of a company. It is important to note that most companies in the state will feel similar pressure at the same time as those factors affect all the companies. There are moral factors that also come to affect the premiums of auto insurance. When drivers report fewer annual miles than they actually drive, that increases their exposure without increasing the premium for their policy. If people allow other drivers to operate their vehicles without adequate supervision of screening risky drivers could be populating the streets. Even though your state requires that vehicles be insured we all know that some are not and that expense has to be shared somewhere. A frequent abuse is the pizza delivery man who is driving the family sedan. His insurance policy never knew he was doing that and has a risk that hasnt been properly evaluated. There are far more lurid cases but my all-time favorite is the family sedan that has steel tanks welded underneath the body to carry illegal liquor. All these moral issues also affect the premium."
336,Which  Is  Better  Medicare  Or  Medicare  Advantage?,"Original Medicare, with or without a supplement plan, allows you to use any doctor, lab or hospital anywhere in the U.S. that accepts Medicare assignment. Most Medicare Advantage plans have limited network that require you to use their participating facilities or else you pay a significant penalty for out of network benefits."
337,What  Will  Void  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"what will void a life insurance policy ? Basically any deciet given during the application process will void a policy if found out within the first two policy years. After that, in most cases contestability by an insurance carrier has ended. Except some states have modified contestibility laws sometimes in the insurance company's favor. In my state, concerning lying about smoking on the application, there is no limit for an insurance company to contest. The state considers the policy null and void. Other states may have something similar."
338,Does  Liberty  Mutual  Have  Life  Insurance?,"Liberty Mutual offers life insurance issued by Liberty Life Assurance Company of Boston, MA. The type of life insurance products that are offered by Liberty Life are Term Life, Whole Life and Universal Life. To compare the price of life insurance from Liberty Life with the price of life insurance offered by other companies, call an agency that carriers several products or find a website on the internet that will compare rates for you."
339,Does  Variable  Life  Insurance  Have  A  Cash  Value?,"Cash value permanent life insurance has the potential to accumulate cash values, but it's dependent on the crediting method. Variable life insurance uses a guaranteed interest rate account and separate sub accounts that use equities and bond investments. The optimal design for cash value is purchasing the lowest TAMRA compliant death benefit option."
340,What  Is  The  Yearly  Cost  Of  Medicare?,"To the average Medicare recipient, the yearly cost of Medicare Part A is free. If there is a charge due to being ineligible for free Part A, there is a premium of up to $441/month. There are deductibles and co-pays for services provided under Medicare Part A. For Part B, the premium to the average Medicare recipient is $140.90/mo. There is an annual deductible of $147/year and 20% co-pay for services and supplies received."
341,Can  I  Buy  A  Life  Insurance  Policy  On  My  Parents?,"You can purchase life insurance coverage on anyone you share an economic insurable interest, including parents. Of course, they need to sign as the policy insured on the application and have to be mentally competent to do so. Life insurance policies held between different family generations are quite common."
342,Can  Home  Insurance  Cover  Plumbing?,Homeowners insurance will not cover plumbing for normal wear and tear. In other words if the pipes just get old and you need new pipes they are not covered. If a pipe were to burst suddenly and flood your kitchen for example the insurance would pick up the damage caused by the water but will not fix the pipe. This is assuming of course water damage is not excluded from your policy.
343,How  To  Get  Health  Insurance  For  A  LLC?,"Purchasing health insurance for an LLC is no different than applying for an individual or group health insurance plan. If the LLC has few or one one employee then individual policies would make the most financial sense. If the LLC wants to provide benefits for all its employees then either a small group plan or a defined benefit plan will make sense. Group's plans require an in depth fact finding analysis to uncover the true needs of the group. Important factors include: Size of the group Number of employee participating Amount employer wants to subsidize - if any? Type of benefits Are employees local or spread out among states The new trend in 2014 for small group is setting up a defined contribution plan (section 105 plan) where the employer subsidizes a set amount to employees tax-free and the employees use that money to offset their health insurance premium, costs etc for the individual plans they purchase."
344,How  To  Set  Up  A  Trust  For  Life  Insurance?,"To set up an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT), it is best to use an attorney who is an expert at tax laws to set up the trust. Then use a respected life insurance agent to help you obtain a policy, or transfer existing life insurance, into the trust. You will need to choose a trustee to administer the trust (this could be the lawyer). Working together, you will get a trust that works for your lifetime."
345,Can  You  Get  Medicare  While  Working?,"Yes, you can be on Medicare while working. Many people do postpone going on Medicare if they're still working because they may have group health insurance available to them through their employer. Self-employed individuals will usually go on Medicare when they turn 65 unless they have group coverage available through their spouse's work. Some may decide to go on Medicare if they're 65 and still working because they want a more predictable health expense structure and/or want to lower their premiums."
346,Where  Do  I  Buy  Life  Insurance?,"You can buy life insurance online, by mail, or by meeting with an agent at their office or your home. Life insurance policies that are purchased without any contact with an agent are usually simplified issue policies. They generally are for smaller face amounts and do not require an exam. While the transaction can be simple, it takes a pretty insurance savvy person to read and understand all the fine print. Thus, it is easy to get declined, or not get the price or policy you were seeking. I recommend calling an agency that carries both simplified and fully underwritten policies, so that you can ask questions and will be given an accurate description of each type of policy before you make your decision. Most types of life insurance can be purchased online or by meeting with an agent face to face. Looking at testimonials and checking Better Business Bureau ratings can be helpful in determining which agency you want to patronize. Reading answers from different agents on this website is also a good way to ""meet"" us and decide for yourself who appears to be knowledgeable and trustworthy."
347,What  Makes  Car  Insurance  Cheaper?,"If you are asking what helps keep your auto insurance rates lower, then there are many factors that can help with this. A clean driving record would be the first - no tickets and no accidents. A high credit score would be another. If you are a student a 3.50 gpa or above will typically get you a discount. A married person will typically have lower rates than a single person. There are many other factors can come into play here also, but these are some of the most prominent ones."
348,How  Long  Does  It  Take  To  Claim  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Death claims are handled quickly. The company needs a death certificate and in some cases a simple form. When the death is under investigation, or the body has not been recovered, the claim can take a long time. Ultimately a court will decide when the insurance company should honor the claim and to whom the proceeds should be paid."
349,"I  am  a  non  driver  and  need  a  truck  for  my  work,  I  would  like  to  insure  my  helper  to  drive  for  me  any  problems?","If you are insuring a vehicle for your business you can write the business auto policy and list your employee or employees as a drivers. You have the ability to exclude yourself from the policy. But keep in mind, this would mean you can not drive the vehicle at anytime as you yourself would then be un-insured."
350,What  Is  The  Best  Medicare  Health  Plan?,"The best Medicare health plan is one that meets your expectations for coverage and price. There are basically two types of Medicare health plans. One is a supplement to traditional Medicare and covers some or all of your out of pocket expenses. These are referred to as Medigap or Medicare supplement plans. The other is a Medicare Advantage plan that replaces traditional Medicare. With Advantage plans your doctor, if they accept your Advantage plan, files claims direct with the insurance carrier. Advantage plans have networks, a lot of moving parts and a lot of out of pocket. #GeorgiaMedicarePlans"
351,What  Is  Group  Disability  Insurance?,"Group Disability Insurance is disability insurance coverage offered to a group of employees through their employer or entity for which they work. It is one of the benefits offered to some employees. If the employer pays the Disability Group Insurance premiums for the employee, disability income benefits would be taxable to the employee when used."
352,Can  You  Claim  Lost  Car  Keys  On  Insurance?,"Yes you could if you had comprehensive coverage. However since most key costs are under the deductible amount it would not make much sense to ruin your claims free discount in order to receive $0 from the insurance company. Even if you had a $100 deductible and the electronic keys were $150, the discounts lost plus having a claim on your record would outweigh any benefit to receiving the $50."
353,Which  Car  Insurance  Company  Is  Best?,"Car insurance companies that do business in your state are regulated by two state insurance commissioners, your state and the state where the company is domiciled. Your state commissioner is trying to allow companies to operate in your state that will keep their promises. The best auto insurance company is one that keeps its promises."
354,Who  Writes  Vacant  Home  Insurance?,There are many carriers that will write coverage for a vacant home. There are of course requirements/standards that the home must meet before a carrier will provide coverage. A carrier that is in my geographic location that I work with that provides this type of coverage is Foremost. I would suggest contacting local agents in your area to find out about availability and pricing in your area.
355,What  Type  Of  Water  Damage  Is  Covered  By  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Not all! Accidental discharge of water and its attendant damages is normally covered. This means when there is an accidental discharge of liquids or steam from the plumbing, heating or air-conditionaing the loss is a covered loss. It is very important to understand what is not covered. Flood is one of the most common causes of loss in the US and the homeowner's policy does not cover it. Water back up such as from a blocked sewer line is not a covered loss (some companies offer the coverage as an option.) When there is repeated or continuous seepage or leakage from a system in the house that is not covered."
356,When  Getting  Car  Insurance  What  Information  Is  Needed?,"Great Question. You will need to provide your personal and vehicleinformation such as: Your full name Driver's license number & expiration date. Possibly your social security number depending on what state you live in. date of birth address of where the car is located and mailing address if different vehicle information such as Year, Make, Model, & V.I.N which is a 17 digit number Is the vehicle garaged or not? How is the vehicle used? How many miles are currently on the vehicle and how many miles to you drive on an annual basis? Names of any possible drivers or people living with you along with their personal information if they wish to drive the vehicle. Need to know who your current insurance is with or if you have had coverage in the past You will need to determine how much coverage you need in place and what deductibles you would be comfortable having in place. There are probably a few more questions that you would need to answer prior to binding coverage, but that is a quick list of information you should have handy when you are ready to pursue auto insurance quotations. I hope this helps and have a wondeful day. Best, Josh DeBoer Producer Fred Daniel & Sons, Inc"
357,Do  I  Need  Builders  Risk  Insurance  To  Purchase  A  Home  Where  We  will  Do  Major  Renovations  Before  Moving  In?,"I don't recommend using the builder to purchase the builders risk policy on a renovation project. You need coverage on the existing structure and most builders would not be covering anything but the renovation amount. They would only be covering the amount of the renovation. Purchasing the policy yourself puts you in control of the policy and allows you to make sure that you are adequately covered. In looking at David's response, I am in agreement that you should be named as additional insured on the contractors general liability policy and also get a certificate for their workers compensation."
358,Does  Medicare  Cover  Ptosis?,There are situations where Medicare will cover Ptosis. Your eye care provider will measure the amount of droop and advise you if the surgery is a covered expense or not. They can also tell you if there may be any excess charges that are part of your treatment that may not be covered by Medicare.
359,How  Much  More  Does  Medicare  Advantage  Cost?,How much more than what? You can find Medicare Advantage plans from zero premium on up. So I guess you would have to say it costs exactly the same as original Medicare A&B. You can spend more though if you want to. Some Medicare Advantage plans do have a premium. You should review the options in your county at www.medicare.gov or talk with your local insurance agent that specializes with Medicare Insurance Plans.
360,Can  You  Change  From  Medicare  Advantage  To  Medigap?,You can disenroll from your Medicare Advantage Plan and switch back to Original Medicare from January 1 thru February 14 of each year. You will need to get a Medicare Supplement and Prescription Drug Plan. If you have serious health conditions you may not be qualify for a Medicare Supplement. Depending on the pre-existing condition you could be denied coverage or have to pay a much higher premium because of the pre-existing condition. It would be very important to talk with a qualified agent before you make your decision to disenroll from your Medicare Advantage Plan.
361,Will  My  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Mold  Damage?,"There are hundreds of species of mold common to the United States. Small areas of visible mold that build up on moist areas in a home not only look bad but are also a health risk, the mold may cause allergy like symptoms and/or breathing difficulties. Basic home insurance policies, generally limit coverage for mold or exclude it. It is very easy for mold to grow given suitable conditions in a home that doesn't show pride of ownership; mold claims became so excessive in prior years, the insurance industry chose to limit or exclude coverage rather than raise premium to address the growing claims. Although the standard coverage will vary from State to State as well as vary between insurance carriers, it is important to view your specific insurance policy to find out if there is coverage for mold and what the limit is.In some cases, a carrier will actually allow an extended amount of coveragefor an additional premium. It is best to maintain a clean and moisture free structure to prevent the growth of mold. In homes with a basement, it is important to remove all moisture as quickly as possible following any leaks. The Federal EPA recommends homeowners clean up any area affected by mold which is less than 10 square feet using bleach or a suitable product, any area larger than that should involve a professional."
362,What  Insurance  Will  I  Need  In  Retirement?,"Your insurance needs do not disappear at retirement although the coverage amounts may change. Car Insurance, home owners insurance, health insurance and life insurance all play a part in a solid financial plan. You should contact an Agent and have them conduct an Insurance preview. The last thing you want in retirement is to be paying for something that you really don't need to."
363,What  Is  A  Cafeteria  Plan  For  Health  Insurance?,"A ""cafeteria plan"" refers to the section 125 of the tax code. A cafeteria plan allows you to have dollars deducted from your payroll at your employment to pay for some health insurance costs with ""pretax dollars"" like child care or prescriptions and doctor visits expenses, and to save for retirement. While the plans may vary from employer to employer in exact details you would be smart to utilize that ""cafeteria plan"". One word of caution- make sure any dollars saved if not used this year rolls over to the next year and that you DO NOT LOSE THE DOLLARS"
364,What  Auto  Insurance  Is  Required  By  Law?,"If you live in a state that requires auto insurance typically the coverages that would be required are bodily injury, property damage, and uninsured motorist at minimum. Regulations are different from state to state. The amounts and types of coverage can vary greatly. Contact a local agent to know what the coverage requirements are for the state that you reside in."
365,Does  My  Medicare  Cover  My  Wife?,Your wife must be qualified for Medicare to receive benefits. If you are over 65 and on Medicare she can qualify based on your work history. If your wife is not yet 65 or Social Security Disability then she will have to pick up a private insurance plan until she is eligible for Medicare. She cannot be covered by your benefits.
366,What  Are  The  Coverage  Characteristics  Of  Home  Insurance?,"A home is the largest single purchase that most people make in their lifetime. There are two characteristics that make home ownership difficult. The first is that the ownership of a home creates a situation of responsibility where you become responsible for personal injury and property damage that comes out of home ownership. For example, someone enters you home, slips on a rug and falls. Injuries can be minor or severe. It is quite possible that you could be sued to recover the loss sustained by the person who fell. This is a liability loss. The second is that you have an enormous amount of your money and the mortgage companys money invested in the home. It is usually a multiple of your annual income and would represent a great financial loss were the home to be destroyed. Your mortgage company is particularly concerned about losing their collateral and will require hazard insurance to protect their interests to the greatest extent possible. The list of things that could happen to damage a residence is lengthy but most of the causes or perils are contained in the HO-3 Homeowners policy. There are notable exceptions which should be restated. You are probably not covered for damage caused by earthquake or flood. These coverages are available but in slightly different forms and often with different policies. Because an individual cannot sustain the personal loss of a law suit or the destruction of their property they turn to an insurance company to pool their risk with hundreds of thousands of other residences. This recognizes the probability of damage and spreads that risk over a large number of residences. The insurance company charges enough to be able to pay those losses when they occur. Your state insurance commissioner is very concerned about the adequacy of the insurance companies admitted in your state. While there are various types of home insurance policies, I will confine my comments to the most common, the HO-3 Homeowners policy. Coverage A in a homeowners policy covers your residence. The coverage includes additional items but does not cover land or water. It doesnt cover trees except as covered in incidental coverages. Coverage B covers related structures on the property. It has the same restrictions as Coverage A and doesnt cover any business structures, except for a residence on the property that you lease to others. It covers you garage Coverage C covers the personal property that you either own or are responsible for. This is a very important coverage and contains internal limits on selected classes of property such as money, securities, jewelry, guns and watercraft. Misunderstandings often arise about this coverage and it should be discussed thoroughly with your insurance agent. Modifications of this coverage are relatively inexpensive and an unpaid claim is an expensive way to discover that you werent adequately covered. Coverage D pays the necessary and reasonable increase in living cost you incur when your household meets with an insured loss. The company will try to get you back into your residence as quickly as possible but will make sure that you are able to maintain your normal standard of living during the repairs. Coverage D also covers the loss of rents you might experience in the event of a covered loss. If you have an apartment on the premises and it is damaged by a covered loss, this section would apply. There are other limits and extensions in this section that require your attention if you are leasing property. There are number of ancillary coverages including credit cards, trees, fire department charges, debris removal, emergency removal of covered property and grave markers. There are several pages of definitions and exclusions which should be read. Most confusion arising from a homeowners policy come from this part of the policy. Many people think that a homeowners policy pays for routine maintenance or deterioration. Coverage L covers personal liability and provides that the company will pay up to the limits for expense that you are liable for because of bodily injury or property damage that happens on your premises. Coverage M covers medical payments to others and provides necessary medial expenses if they are incurred on your property and result in bodily injury. There are several pages of definitions and limitations on liability coverage. The policy then defines your responsibilities. You must notify the company of a loss, you must cooperate and many other responsibilities. At the back of the policy are a number of endorsements which changes the policy. These apply to specific types of property such as trading cards, animals, a roof and others. Together the HO-3 Homeowners policy is a package of protection that is sufficiently broad to meet the requirements of both lenders and homeowners. Special additional coverages are offered and should be considered. Many of these additional coverages can be included in the basic policy."
367,What  Is  Survivorship  Universal  Life  Insurance?,"The only thing that separates this from other policies is the word survivorship. What this means is that the policy covers at least 2 individuals and it only pays a benefit with the last one dies. Survivorship policies are usually smaller face amount policies taken out by couples with larger estates. The reason they do this is to use the death benefit to cover or offset estate taxes for their heirs. I have personally not seen one done with a universal life policy. Reason being is the cost. In a majority of cases, it would probably be more cost-effective to use a traditional whole life policy for this purpose."
368,Does  Medicare  Pay  For  A  Walker?,Yes - Medicare covers walkers under Part B as durable medical equipment (DME) when prescribed by your doctor for use in your home. Medicare will generally pay approximately 80% of the costs - you would be responsible for the other 20%. A Medicare supplement (Medigap) plan can help cover the expenses you're responsible for paying.
369,How  Can  I  Get  Car  Insurance  As  A  High  Risk  Driver?,Just because you are a high risk driver doesn't mean you can't find auto insurance. As long as you have a valid driver's license and are willing to pay the required premium you should be able to find coverage. Call a local agent to find out more about coverage availability and pricing.
370,Which  Annuity  Is  Right  For  Me?,"You have to establish product suitability before deciding on any product, much less an annuity, which should be purchased as an ultimate income product. Product suitability is based on your personal financial profile, risk tolerance and economic goals. Those three areas comprise the fundamental approach to selecting the right annuity. Annuities use differing crediting methods such as interest rates, indices (both domestic and foreign) and separate sub accounts that use equities and bond allocations."
371,Can  You  Get  Life  Insurance  While  Pregnant?,"I just asked this question of several companies for someone I know and the answer is yes. The rating will the same as if you were not pregnant, if in the first trimesters. There are also no exam policies that you can get all the way through the third trimester."
372,Does  Medicare  Insurance  Cover  Dental?,"Routine dental checkups, cleanings, dental x-rays, crowns, etc. are not covered under original Medicare (parts A & B). You would need to buy a separate dental insurance plan to cover these benefits. If you have a medically necessary procedure completed in a hospital such as the repair of a broken jaw, then Medicare would cover it because it was an emergency situation. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
373,Can  I  Get  Life  Insurance  If  I  Have  Diabetes?,Yes you can. The rate will depend on age of onset and degree of control. You will probably pay a higher rate but you can get insurance. A good independent life insurance agent or broker can look at your individual situation and find a company that is affordable for you.
374,What  Company  Has  The  Best  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"The best long term care insurance company and its product must be determined by gender, age, smoking status, health history and current health condition. That being said, there are only a half dozen or so long term care insurance companies in the brokerage market. Genworth should be considered as a leader in the long term care insurance market."
375,What  Is  Basic  Life  And  Ad  D  Insurance?,"Basic life insurance pays a beneficiary if death of the insured person occurs by any reason (except suicide in the first two years). AD&D stands for Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance. It pays the beneficiary if death occurs by accident, or it pays the insured person if they lose a limb. Basic Life with AD&D is most likely a policy that combines both those types of insurance."
376,Does  Medicare  Cover  Compounded  Drugs?,"In order for compounded drugs to be covered by Medicare Part D, they must be prescribed for a ""medically accepted indication"", they must have at least one ingredient that is FDA approved, and at least one ingredient must be covered by Medicare Part D. Only that FDA approved ingredient and the fees for mixing the drug are covered by Medicare. Bulk powders are not covered."
377,What  Is  Participation  Rate  In  Annuities?,"Generally speaking, tax deferred index annuities use domestic and foreign indices for its crediting method. But there are three crediting method types within any one policy (sometimes more) that play a role in what you receive from the indice performance: spreads, rate caps and participation percentage. Participation determines what portion of the performance is credited to the annuity policy, i.e. 70% of a 10% net return would credited 7%."
378,What  Is  A  5  Year  Term  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"As mentioned above, a 5 year term insurance is an insurance policy that is in force for 5 years then expires. It is designed for a short term need and or specifically for the purpose of converting to a Whole Life policy within that 5 year period. Most Term policies are ""convertible"" to permanent insurance and some companies limit the type of permanent insurance their term policies may be converted to. In ""converting"" a term to a permanent policy what happens is the face amount of the Term, or a portion of that amount is converted to a Whole Life or Universal life policy without the insured having to undergo additional medical testing or underwriting. The premiums paid to the Term policy are not credited to the new permanent policy and the new premium will be based on the current age of the insured."
379,How  Do  You  Set  Up  Annuities?,"You will need to contact a good insurance agent who is familiar with annuities and can offer a multitude of companies. The agent can examine your needs, goals and personal circumstances and help determine if an annuity is suitable for you, and if so help direct you to an annuity that fits your circumstances. The agent will then help you apply."
380,When  Is  Permanent  Life  Insurance  A  Good  Idea?,When permanent life insurance is a good thing? That depends on who you ask! Some would say only if you have dependents or someone you want to leave an inheritance to. But the fact is that Whole Life is perhaps the safest way to grow your money! It offers a guaranteed interest rate and with mutual providers it also offers dividends. It is a much better vehicle to save and grow your money that any bank instruments - guaranteed returns and Liquid for your use. Also with tax benefits not offered anywhere else! So when is permanent life insurance a good thing...ALLways!
381,How  Long  Will  Disability  Insurance  Pay?,"Disability insurance will pay benefits to the disabled person according to the terms of the policy that was purchased. The ""elimination period"" determines at what point payments start. This may be a few months to a year after the disability occurs. The duration of the plan dictates how long the Disability Insurance pays. This may be a few years all the way to age 65."
382,What  Is  Philippine  Prudential  Life  Insurance?,"Philippine Prudential Life Insurance Company (Philippine Prudential) is a 100% Filipino owned financial services company. They offer endowment plans, whole life plans, group and permanent plans, healthcare coverage, education and pensions policies, and credit insurance. Philippine Prudential Life Insurance Company was established in 1963 and is headquartered in Pasig City, Philippines."
383,How  Much  Is  Life  Insurance  For  A  60  Year  Old?,"There's many factors that go into the premium calculations for life insurance to say what coverage will cost for a 60 year old - it will be different for every person due to a number of factors including their age, amount of coverage they want, how long they want the coverage for, their risk classifcation, and whether they're applying with full underwriting or non-medical term coverage. At age 60, you'll have term life insurance options for 10, 15, 20, or 25 years - 30 years term insurance would not be available due to age - you would need to look at permanent programs to secure coverage longer than 25 years. If you want to consider coverage beyond 25 years, I would suggest looking at a Guaranteed Universal Life insurance policy (GUL). If you're looking for something in the $100,000, 10yr term insurance range, you could be looking at premiums as low as $28 per month (at preferred plus risk class) to over $100+ per month (if you're table-rated), it ultimately depends on the risk classification you qualify for. $250,000, 15 yr term can be as low as $82 per month or over $154 per month at standard risk class. So on and so forth. However, any numbers I quote without more details regarding your medical history will be useless. The risk classification is the MOST critical factor in determining the cost (premium) of a life insurance policy. The risk class depends on a number of factors including whether you're male or female, your medical history, prescriptions you take, your height/weight profile, any tobacco usage, family medical history, and other factors. Please keep in mind - every carrier has different underwriting guidelines, and each may offer a different risk class for a given medical profile - e.g. company A may offer preferred (featuring lower rates) and company B may only offer standard (featuring higher rates). You should always consult with an experienced life insurance broker before applying for ANY coverage. Brokers can shop the case for you among a number of insurance companies to see which one will work best for your program and help you structure a policy that will best serve your needs and your budget. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
384,Can  You  Have  Two  Medicare  Supplements?,"No - only one Medicare supplement plan will pay after Medicare pays. If you try to have 2 Medicare supplement plans, you're spending extra money on the 2nd plan for no reason because it won't pay any benefits. Only one supplement plan will pay. The cost of 2 plans would also be more than having 1 Medigap plan F that covers all 9 benefits at 100%. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any questions. Thanks very much."
385,What  Is  The  Benefit  Of  Renters  Insurance?,Renters insurance is for renters of homes and apartments as house insurance is for those who own the house. Renters insurance protects YOUR property if there is a loss from say a fire. The biggest issue is what kind of policy you have. Does your insurance give yoy replacement cost or just current value. There is a big difference. Think about what you stuff costs today versus purchasing brand new.
386,Does  Life  Insurance  Cover  Alcoholism?,"That is a great question! The answer is yes, unless the answer on the application about drinking was falsified, (generally along the lines of ""have been told they have, been treated for, or prescribed medication for alcohol abuse/dependency or addiction?"", or ""been asked to reduce the intake of or discontinue use of drugs or alcohol?"") or the death occurred as a result of a crime committed while under the influence. Many policies will not pay if the death occurs because of criminal activity, and drunk driving would fall under that category. If the death occurs from long term chronic abuse, the policy should pay, but I'd have your agent confirm that for you. Thanks for asking!"
387,How  Much  Is  A  Good  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Asking how much life insurance cost is like asking a realtor how much a house costs. Could be $30,000 or $30 million it depends on what you want. The factors that an agent or life insurance company would need to begin the quoting process is type of policy,how much face amount, for how long, age, build, state of residence, tobacco use andgeneral health status. From there an agent or broker can get fairly close to a premium quote but understand the underwriters have the final say on your unique premium."
388,Does  QDRO  Apply  To  Life  Insurance?,"QDRO or a Qualified Domestic Relations Order comes through the courts in a divorce case. This order typically deals with divorce settlements concerning finances and retirement plans such as IRAs, Roth IRAs, 401Ks, 403bs and cash value life insurance plans. If you or your ex spouse owns cash value life insurance, then yes, the cash value is included in QDRO calculations. In most cases, term life insurance plans are not included in these calculations because there is no value unless a death occurs. You or your ex spouse can also be court ordered to carry a term life policy to cover alimony and or child support in case of an early death."
389,Can  An  80  Year  Old  Get  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,The time to purchase Long Term Care is when you are healthy and in your fifties or sixties. I do not know of any company that will issue a Long Term Care Policy to an eighty year old and if there were the premium would be extremely high. There are some alternatives however. Some companies will offer Short Term Care or Home Health Care policies up to age 85. While not as comprehensive as a full Long Term Care policy they can help with the high cost of care when needed. There are also other planning solutions that can help. A Long Term Care Resource Planner can help find a solution.
390,Can  You  Cash  Out  A  Retirement  Plan?,"Certainly if it is your retirement plan you can cash out. However, there are many things to consider. If you are younger than 59.5 years old you will incur income taxes and a 10% penalty plus the fees associated from companies and advisors who will charge withdrawal fees and surrender charges. It is not advised just to ""cash out"" a retirement plan at any age. I highly recommend finding a trusted advisor to walk you through this process."
391,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Foreclosure?,Renters nor any other property insurance is designed to insurance against a foreclosure. I have to assume since you arereferencinga renters policy that you are the tenant and your landlord is beingforeclosedon forcing you to move out.Unfortunatelyform an insurance standpoint there is nothing that can be done and you will have to startshoppingfor a new home. Yourrenterspolicy can betransferredto your new address. I would further discussthesituation with your local agent.
392,What  Is  Private  Disability  Insurance?,"Private Disability Insurance is Disability Insurance that is purchased privately vs being supplied by the insured person's employer in a group policy. Persons who are self employed, or who do not have group Disability Insurance because their employer does not offer it, are most likely to buy private Disability Insurance."
393,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Pool  Damage?,"Your homeowners insurance policy covers damages that are caused by specific perils. While it is possible that damage to a swimming pool could be caused by fire or another of the covered perils, I doubt that is the point of this question. Most swimming p0ool difficulties arise from earth movement and that is an excluded peril in most policies."
394,Why  Would  I  Need  A  Medigap  Policy?,"Medicare Part A & Part B only covers about 80% of the cost of your healthcare. In addition, the 20% that you are responsible for does not have a limit. No max out of pocket or cap so if something major happens you could be left with a lot of very expensive medical bills. Millions of Americans age 65 and over buy a Medigap policy to cover what Medicare Part A & B does not. There are several plans to choose from but all Medigap Plans have a letter such as Plan F, Plan G, Plan J, etc. If it doesn't have a letter it's not a Medigap Policy. I would be happy to answer any other questions you have."
395,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  The  Furnace?,"It is always a good idea to talk with your Insurance Professional about the specific terms and conditions of your policy. In general, however, if the damage is caused by a covered peril in your policy, then more than likely there would be coverage for such damage. Keep in mind, however, that a Home Insurance policy is not a maintenance agreement nor does it include coverage for normal wear and tear. In other woreds, if the liner fails resulting in water damage to your property or personal property, the water damage would be covered subject to your deductible, but not the repair or replacement of your furnace."
396,Does  Medicare  Pay  For  LPC?,"No, Medicare does not pay for LPC's, or Licensed Professional Counselors, at this point in time. Legislation has been proposed to include payment for LPC's under Medicare part B. As of now, only Licensed Clinical Social Workers, PhD Psychologists, and Psychiatrists are able to be reimbursed by Medicare for persons needing counseling."
397,How  To  Cancel  Scotia  Life  Insurance?,"To cancel Scotia Life Insurance or any other life insurance policy, the best way to cancel it is to call, email, or write the company to inform them that you are cancelling it. Their website lists their life insurance contact number as 800-387-9844. However, if you are unable to reach them, you can simply quit paying your premium and the policy will lapse by itself after one month of unpaid premium."
398,How  To  Know  If  Someone  Had  Life  Insurance?,"To find out if someone had life insurance you will have to do some digging and asking. Most people respect making that purchase and keep a record of it somewhere. Relatives may know. You could contact a local insurance agency where that person did business. If all else fails, unclaimed life insurance will eventually be turned over to the unclaimed property files in the state where the policy was purchased."
399,How  Does  Health  Insurance  Affect  The  Retirement  Behavior  Of  Women?,"Great question! While I do not have a degree in sociology or statistics, I can tell you what I see, working daily with retired, or near retirement aged women clients. Each and every one of them appreciate it. Most of them are no longer working, though almost all of them had expected to be. The ones that still have insurance through work or their spouses work are not burdened with the fear of being unable to get medical services. The rest of them are enrolled in Medicare, or Medicaid. Those ladies also are profoundly grateful to be able to receive medical care that is affordable. Many of those women struggle to balance medical costs with the everyday expenses of heat, food, and electricity though, as the benefits are often not enough even with Social Security to make ends meet. Without health insurance they would be in a very bad way. If this did not answer your question, (And I'll admit I'm not sure what you are asking, since having insurance or not having it probably affects them the same way it would a man, or someone younger) please feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to discuss this with you further. Thanks for asking!"
400,Is  A  Chiropractor  Covered  By  Medicare?,"Chiropractic care is covered by Medicare in some situations. Medicare Part B pays for a chiropractor's manual manipulation of the spine to correct subluxation. If a hand held device is used during the manual manipulation, the use of the device is not covered. Initial physical exams, evaluations, X-rays, acupuncture, physical therapy, supplements and orthopedic devices prescribed or provided by a chiropractor are NOT covered."
401,What  Company  Has  The  Cheapest  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  In  Colorado?,"In addition to Peggy's answer I would also look at all the options that are available which may or may not make sense for your situation. There are many ""hybrid"" products now that can provide you monies to cover LTC expenses but also provide other valuable coverage or funds. Look into Life Insurance which gives you access to the death benefit what you have a chronic condition. Please be aware that before you purchase any of these products I want you to understand what is covered and what is not. I am simply saying here there are alternatives versus just purchasing a Long-Term care policy which can be cost prohibited."
402,How  Much  Renters  Insurance  Do  I  Need  For  An  Apartment?,"That is a question I get asked everyday. It truly depends on how much ""stuff"" you own and want replaced. Many insurers have a minimum amount of coverage needed for replacement coverage to be part of the policy. Typically it is $20,000. You want to have replacement coverage so that your items are replaced with new items, not depreciated costs. A TV you purchased 3 years ago is worth much less than its replacement. A good rule of thumb to use is $10,000 per room rented. This may seem like a lot at first, but when you start adding everything up over time that you have purchased, you will see that it is reasonable."
403,How  Much  Home  Insurance  Is  Needed?,The amount of coverage carried on a home is determined by the cost to replace the building and contents and the requirements of your lender. In California lenders cannot require coverage in excess of the cost of replacement but when prices rise lenders sometimes pressure homeowners to carry more coverage to protect their investment. The insurance company will require an independent evaluation of the reconstruction cost and your agent is the best person to help you. There has been a great deal of discussion concerning catastrophic losses where neighborhoods or communities are destroyed. The problem then is a shortage of material and contractors to restore damaged dwellings. In these circumstances building costs can escalate quickly. If you sense that you might be in such a potential situation be sure to discuss that with your agent.
404,Who  Is  The  Best  Auto  Insurance  Provider?,"Because insurance is regulated by each state, there really is not only one answer to that question. Insurance companies are rated online for their financial strength, and customer satisfaction by several independent reporting agencies. My company posts our results on our website here: WEBSITELINK People choose different companies for different reasons, A friendly referral, price, or special features. What is most important to you?"
405,Where  To  Complain  About  Home  Insurance?,"If you have an agent that you trust, start there. Insurance companies respond to complaints and you can usually reach the company by mail, email or in many cases, directly through the company website. The insurance commissioner in your state is also interested in your complaint. My recommendation is to approach the three levels that I mentioned one at a time, giving each sufficient time to respond. If you complain everywhere at once, it can cause a lot of confusion."
406,Is  Medigap  Or  Medicare  Advantage  Better?,"It depends on your personal situation. I personally like Medigap if you can afford the premiums. With Medigap you will not have to worry about networks, you can go to any doctor that accepts Medicare, and your out of pocket exposure will be much less. Medicare Advantage is a good choice for those with limited funds or those who live in an area where there are strong networks, as long as you do not travel outside the area for extended periods. Medicare Advantage has the Prescription coverage embedded in the plan (in most cases) and can have very low or no premium. A good independent agent who handles both Medigap and Medicare Advantage can help guide you. Make sure the agent handles most of the plans in your area and takes time to ask about your personal situation."
407,When  To  Surrender  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"When considering the surrender of a life insurance policy you have to ask yourself some questions. Does anyone I care about suffer without this life insurance policy? Who needs my income? Who would be responsible for my debt? I am wealthy enough to be sure my loved ones are taken care of financially? If you find that there is no longer that need for life insurance, then it is time to surrender the policy. Remember the increase incash value that accumulated is now taxable as income upon surrender."
408,What  Is  Life  Insurance  Advantages  And  Disadvantages?,"The advantages of life insurance are three fold. The death benefit proceeds can pay the bills, fund future obligations and make a difference for your children and charities. The economic leverage for a healthy insured is significant and the tax advantages considerable. The diversity of the product line can be customized to the individual consumer. The only disadvantage of life insurance, like any other product, is that you have to pay for it."
409,Much  Does  Health  Insurance  Cost  One  Person?,"The rate depends on many factors including your age, where you live, your health and whether you smoke. Monthly rates could vary between $25 per month to $250 per month (or much higher) depending on these factors. And of course, different carriers such as Anthem, Aetna, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare etc... will charge different premiums. To view rates, you can visit a reputable website that offers free online quotes. There is no obligation and you can easily apply online for coverage after viewing your best options. You may also receive a federal tax subsidy when State Exchanges are operational. Naturally, an experienced broker can also assist you."
410,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  A  Broken  Laptop?,"If the laptop is broken as the result of a covered peril the renters policy will pay to make it whole. The payment will be subject to the deductible and if the computer has depreciated very much your reimbursement might not be significant. If the computer is damaged by negligence or if it simply is running out of gas, then it probably wont be covered at all."
411,Is  Life  Insurance  Taxable  To  The  Beneficiary  In  Illinois?,"Life insurance proceeds are not taxed. The proceeds are directed to the named beneficiary. This is also a great option for estate planning. Tangible assets depending on how it's structured, may be taxed. It's best to meet with a licensed professional to design a program that can eliminate taxes to be paid. Life insurance can offset any taxes to be paid."
412,Can  I  Be  Denied  Health  Insurance?,At this time yes you can. However that is soon to change. Beginning in January of 2014 the affordable care act mandates that no one can be denied coverage based on pre-existing conditions. You will be able to take out a policy in or out of the exchange. You also cannot be charged more premium because of your health.
413,Why  Do  Kids  Need  Life  Insurance?,"Since the purpose of life insurance is usually to protect someone from an economic loss that would be caused by the death of the Insured person, this is a good question. Why do kids need life insurance? In light of the stated purpose, perhaps this need does not exist in your family. If the unspeakable happened and you lost a child, you may have plenty of resources to cover final arrangements, even if there were medical bills. If not, then a life insurance policy for a child, or putting the child(ren) on a child rider on your policy, would be a valid choice. However, because I specialize in Impaired Risk life insurance (life insurance for those who have health conditions or other risk), I see the biggest advantage of kids having life insurance as ensuring they will be able to get affordable life insurance for the rest of their lives. There is a huge advantage to getting them insured while they are still healthy. E.g. A child who develops type 1 diabetes will not be able to get a life insurance policy until they are at least 16 years old, and then far above average rates will follow them the rest of their lives. If they got even a term policy before developing diabetes, the policy can later be converted to a permanent policy at the same health rating they got before they were diagnosed. If on a child rider, they can get 5 times the amount of the rider rated Standard when they become adults, no health questions asked. There is a tendency to not think about life insurance until there is a scare in one's health. Having life insurance as a child just takes care of it, no matter what the future brings."
414,Does  Disability  Insurance  Have  A  Cash  Value?,"Disability Insurance is a morbidity product with no accumulating cash values. The benefits of a disability insurance product are not considered an asset, but an insurance claim. Although most disability insurance claims are tax free, businesses that expensed the disability insurance premiums as a tax deduction, receive the benefits taxable as ordinary income."
415,How  Much  Life  Insurance  Should  You  Carry?,"That is an excellent question! The answer is that it depends upon what you want the insurance to do for you. If it is just to cover funeral expenses, then typically a smaller, $10-20,000 policy should be fine. If you are trying to cover mortgage, college, or other major debt that would be left to your spouse, then you want at least that much. If it is to provide a legacy for your children, then however much you'd like to bless them with is the amount needed. If it is to provide your spouse with the income lost when you pass, then you will want to do some math, and decide upon how many years' salary to choose. If you need help, please contact me, okay? I'd be happy to help. Thanks for asking!"
416,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Stolen  Bike?,"If your personal property includes a bicycle, it will be covered under a renters policy. If the bicycle is stolen from your unit it will be covered to the property limit of the policy after satisfying the deductible. If you have a $400 bicycle and it is stolen, and if your policy has a $250 deductible, you can expect a settlement in the range of $150. If the bicycle is stolen from the bicycle rack in front of the Biology building then the amount of coverage is reduced to about ten per cent of the personal property limit of the policy. Subject to that reduced limit the claim would be adjusted in the same manner."
417,What  Are  The  Benefits  Of  Having  Renters  Insurance?,"That is a great question! The best reason to have renter's insurance is that they pay to replace the things that you have that become stolen or destroyed. Most of us do not have that kind of money. Another is that if your apartment was unlivable due to damage, the policy often covers your stay at a hotel until adequate repairs have been made. The last, and probably best benefit is that it is one less thing to have to worry about. I hope that helps, thanks for asking!"
418,Where  Can  I  Get  Whole  Life  Insurance?,"You can get whole life insurance from an agency or website that sells it. Try calling to ask if they sell whole life in all face amounts, and ask the ratings of the companies through which their whole life insurance is sold. It the agency only sells it up to a certain face amount, they only sell final expense whole life. That is a good choice if you need final expense coverage, but to get whole life in larger face amounts, you need to make sure you are getting a competitive product."
419,Is  My  Child  Covered  By  My  Auto  Insurance?,"Auto insurance follows the car not the driver or occupant. If your child is unlicensed and operating the car, the provisions of the policy would remain in effect. If your child is an occupant in the car and is hurt in an accident for which the driver of your car is at fault, there can be limited coverage for his medical care. If the driver of the other car is determined to be at fault your childs medical cost will ultimately be paid by the other driver. If your child is struck by a motor vehicle while a pedestrian there can be limited medical coverage."
420,What  Is  Medicare  Part  B  Used  For?,"Medicare Part B covers most outpatient treatment that Medicare considers medically necessary. Just a few of your covered expenses include doctor visits, lab work, X-rays, CT scans, MRI, medical transport (ambulance), Emergency Room, outpatient surgery, infusion therapy in a clinic or hospital setting. Some infusion drugs are also covered by Part B."
421,What  Is  Covered  With  Renters  Insurance?,"Your coverage will vary from policy to policy and carrier to carrier. Typically a renters insurance policy will provide coverage for losses caused by fire, smoke, lightning, and other perils. It will also typically provide some monetary coverage for accidents that occur on your covered premise that you are deemed responsible for and money to secure another place of residence after being displaced by a covered loss. Remember every policy is different. Please read your policy completely to understand the coverage provided and any exclusions that there may be or contact your local agent to have them go over the policy with you."
422,How  To  Borrow  From  A  Retirement  Plan?,"Retirement monies are meant for your golden years. borrowing against your future is altering the lifestyle in your senior years. That said, there are emergencies that may be beyond your cash reserves and your retirement monies may be the only resource available. Most plans charge interest and require a repayment schedule. All loans must be repaid before any transfer to another plan. If your terminated, your loans must be repaid or the the plan administrator may issue a 1099."
423,Can  You  Keep  Auto  Insurance  Claim  Money?,"Here is the thing. Insurance claim settlements are intended to pay for the repair of damage caused by a covered loss under the provisions of a policy contract, in this case an car insurance policy. If one receives a settlement and then chooses, for whatever reason not to repair the damage, I have not seen a case where an insurance company is going to be looking for it's money back. Keep in mind acouple of things, however. If you have a lien or lease on your car, the check will be made payable to BOTH you and the financial institution and they will need to have the car repaired as a condition of your agreement with them. Also, if you happen to have another incident that further damages the same car parts that were damaged previously, the claims professional will be able to tell the older damage from the more recent and will NOT include an amount needed to repair both."
424,Does  Home  Insurance  Cover  Central  Air?,Unless you have an equipment breakdown endorsement or policy with your homeowners coverage your central air unit will not typically be covered. Remember every policy is different. Please read your policy completely to understand the coverage provided and any exclusions that there may be or contact your local agent to have them go over the policy with you.
425,Can  I  Cancel  My  Health  Insurance  Without  A  Qualifying  Event?,As long as it is not a group plan or a Medicare Advantage plan you can. An individual health plan or Medicare Supplement can be cancelled at any time. A group plan may require a qualifying event in order to make changes. A Medicare Advantage plan can only be changed during the annual Open Enrollment unless there i a qualifying event.
426,Should  I  Buy  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  In  This  Economy?,"Should you buy long-term care insurance in this economy. The most important factor is ""your"" economy. That is, if your business is insulated from some of the recent economic problems we have been facing, it should not have as big of an impact on your decision compared to most others. However, if you are concerned about your income in the next 5-15 years, this should be taken into account. Of course, you can always start with a lower amount of coverage to keep premiums lower."
427,What  Is  Vesting  Age  In  Life  Insurance?,"Vesting does not relate to life insurance, at least, not in the common uses of the term with respect to pension plans. A policy owner owns any cash values and all policy rights. You might be referring to a surrender charge schedule which exists in many permanent policies, especially Universal Life and related types and is subtracted from the cash accumulation value in the event the policy is canceled early. A surrender charge usually applies in the first several years of the policy e.g. 3-20 years, depending on the policy. Most schedules grade down during this time."
428,I  need  to  purchase  disability  insurance  for  our  library  can  you  help?,"Yes, we can help you however I will need to get more information. First, what state are you located in? I have to be sure what products are available to you. Second, I would like to find out why you are not happy so we can make sure we can provide you the service you require. Feel free to reach me at matt@pegasusii.com or call me at (720)708-5498. Thank you."
429,How  Much  Does  Single  Premium  Life  Insurance  Cost?,"The smallest premium I have seen for single premium life insurance is $1,500. The highest is in the millions. The amount of coverage that you can get for any given single premium depends on your age, health history, tobacco use, gender, height-weight, etc. Your independent agent can give you rates for many companies and help you understand which companies will approve you."
430,What  Does  Suze  Orman  Think  Of  Variable  Annuities?,"Suze has a online summary digest called ""Truth About Annuities."" About half way through the document she addresses variable annuities. Oddly enough she seems to give variable annuities a relatively fair expose' or treatment in her description and potential prospects for variable annuities. It's worth the read to understand her position."
431,Is  Renters  Insurance  Worth  The  Cost?,"I believe that it is. The people that believe that insurance is not worth it's cost have never experienced a major loss those that have experienced a major loss will more than likely tell you that insurance coverage is worth every penny. The question to ask yourself is ""Are you financial secure enough to handle any and all losses or liability claims presented to you or your family?"". If the answer is no then you should have insurance."
432,How  To  Setup  A  Personal  Retirement  Plan?,"How to set up a personal retirement plan is a process. First start with the end in mind determine what retirement success would look like for you. Once you have an idea then you can determine what it would take to fund it. Retirement planning can be complex as there are many factors to consider and it is easy to put it aside for another day. The saying the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step is applicable here - start saving a regular percent of your earnings today. Let the power of compound interest work for you. If you would like to work with a local Retirement Planner, you could start with a Google search. For example, if you search for: retirement planner Halifax or retirement planning Halifax, my name, along with several others, will come up. You can use the same method to find Retirement Planners in your community. If you have further questions, or feel that I could be of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me."
433,Can  Annuities  Be  Pledged  As  Collateral?,"Deferred annuities are personal property and somewhat of a liquid asset that can be pledged as collateral for bank loans. The somewhat is the surrender charges and ordinary income tax due upon the termination of the annuity. The surrender charges affect the collateral holder, the taxes affect the annuity owner."
434,When  To  Buy  Life  Insurance  For  Child?,"As soon as a child is a few weeks old, insurance companies can write life insurance on them. That is actually the best time to purchase it. It is the very least expensive it will ever be and you can lock in that rate for the rest of the child's life, all the while accumulating value which can be borrowed against or used in later years for retirement, with a permanent policy. Thank you. GARY LANE."
435,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Flood  In  Apartments?,Neither renters or homeowners insurance will cover flood damage. Flood insurance pricing is set by the federal government and sold through a limited number of private carriers. To be able to purchase flood insurance you must first find an agent in your area that is licensed to sell this coverage or if you wish you could find a carrier online.
436,What  Do  Life  Insurance  Policies  Cover?,"Life insurance covers the insured of the policy generally to indemnify the beneficiaries i.e. family members or business partner interests. The owner of the policy may also be the insured. But whoever owns the policy, controls the policy. And that means the policy owner could change the beneficiaries without their permission."
437,Why  Would  BCBSTX  Offer  A  Rider  And  A  Rate  Up  For  Migraines?,"It is fairly common in many states to ""rate up"" and exclude a condition. While this does not always seem fair, it is legal and approved by the Department Of Insurance. Your recourse? There is an Open Enrollment in October for 2014 effective dates which should cover your pre-existing condition. Prior to that time, you could apply with another carrier to see if they would cover the condition, with an added charge. But of course, do not cancel your existing policy until you have written approval and have reviewed all provisions of the contract. I realize this was not the answer that solves your dilemma, but in 2014, you might have better luck, especially if you qualify for a federal subsidy."
438,Where  Can  I  Get  Cheap  Homeowners  Insurance?,"Cheap insurance is found by carefully selecting a quality insurance agent. That agent will listen to you, provide sound financial advice and communicate clearly with you and the insurance company. Setting appropriate limits is crucial. The real test of value is when you have a claim. If your policy doesnt meet your expectations, you have purchased expensive insurance, regardless of the premium."
439,How  To  Get  Health  Insurance  If  You  Are  Overweight?,"It is very easy to get health insurance if you are overweight. Thanks to the new Affordable Care Act enacted by President Obama, there are no medical questions and no underwriting. This means that no matter a persons weight, health conditions or pre-existing conditions, everyone will pay the same for health insurance in your area. Insurance premiums are only based on gender, age, and if you have used nicotine in the last 6 months. You can purchase one of these plans through the Marketplace and compare plans and even see if you qualify for help paying for your premiums. You may qualify for help through the government since they are making everyone get insurance, then they are also helping people pay for it if they cannot afford it. Please visit WEBSITELINK for more information or contact me."
440,Can  You  Get  An  Extension  On  Car  Insurance?,"You will find, in talking about this with your Insurance Professional, that in most cases, your car insurance policy includes a ""grace period"" for premium payment. Some non-standard policies do not include this benefit, so be careful. Keep in mind as well that regardless of the length of the grace period, if you ultimately fail to pay on your renewal, coverage will be cancelled back to the policy inception date for that term. If you fail to pay mid term, the policy may be cancelled effective the end of that grace period, which means you would be billed for coverage provided during that grace time."
441,How  Do  I  Know  How  Much  Life  Insurance  I  Need?,"Ask a life insurance professional! There is no substitute for an experienced life insurance professional who can help you plan to have the right amount based on need and budget and can adjust the plan over time to meet changing needs. Most studies suggest many have no life insurance at all and, of those who do, many are underinsured. We often meet with clients who have less than their current annual income. Insurance companies generally approve coverage amounts up to 25X income or more (under age 45). There are many calculators online which can help such as this one: WEBSITELINK Calculators like these help prepare you for meeting with a life insurance professional."
442,Who  Can  Buy  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Almost anyone who wants to buy a life insurance policy can do so. If they are buying it for themselves as the insured person, they must have some sort of income or assets to financially qualify for the amount they are purchasing. If owning a policy on someone else, there must be a close family tie or insurable interest. In the US, those buying life insurance must be citizens, have a Green Card, or (with some companies) have a work Visa."
443,How  Much  Could  Disability  Insurance  Cost?,"Disability insurance depends on a number of factors. The cost (your premium) is based on a number of factors - the most important being your medical history, your job, and your income - and the policies are very customizable. This is a very important type of coverage to have that many don't think about. It protects one of your greatest assets - your ability to work.If you can't work because of an injury or illness, how do you provide income for you and your family. The answer? Your disability insurance. When you're buying a disability policy, the MOST important factor in the policy structure is the DEFINITION OF DISABILITY .Each policy will use 1 of the 3 definitions: 1) True Own Occupation - this says you are considered totally disabled if, solely due to injury or sickness, you are not able to perform the material and substantial duties of your occupation, even if you are at work in another occupation. In short, this is the most favorable definition you can have. 2) Modified Own Occupation - this says that you are considered totally disabled if, solely due to injury or sickness, you are not able to perform the material and substantial duties of your occupation. This one is commonly seen in many individual disability insurance policies. 3) Gainful Occupation - this says if you are unable to perform the duties of your occupation or any occupation for which you are qualified for by education, training, or experience due to sickness or injury. In short, this is the least favorable definition. This one is commonly seen in group disability insurance policies through an employer and property and casualty insurers that offer disability coverage. There are many moving parts to disability insurance and is not something I would suggest trying to buy on your own - this is a type of coverage you should consult with an experienced independent disability insurance broker about. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help with your coverage and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
444,Is  Medicare  Prescription  Drug  Coverage  Mandatory?,"That is a great question! The answer is one of those , ""no, but you should"" answers. Like health insurance isn't mandatory, having it is very wise, and not having it has penalties. It iskind of like that with your prescription coverage. While it isn't mandatory to have, the cost of your prescriptions without it is often prohibitive. A prescription that Medicare covers may only cost you a couple of dollars, that without the coverage would cost $45-50 dollars or more. On a fixed income, and looking at stretching a retirement fund, I'd wholeheartedly recommend that you enroll in the plan. Thanks for asking!"
445,What  To  Look  For  When  Purchasing  Car  Insurance?,When purchasing auto insruance find yourself a local agent that you are comfortable working with. This person will assist you by providing you with the coverage choices that they have available. Depending on your situation they will be able to help suggest coverage levels to help protect you and your family from potential financial hardships.
446,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  ATV  Accidents?,Homeowners insurance generally excludes any type of activity involving a motor vehicle. The question does not really give enough information to answer the question adequately. What this all comes down to is liability. Are you responsible for someone else s bodily injury or property damage and then how did it happen?
447,What  Is  The  Best  Home  Insurance  Policy?,"The most comprehensive home insurance policies are offered by the High Value/High Net Worth insurance companies. These companies include PURE Insurance, AIG's Private Client Group, ACE Insurance & Chubb Insurance. They will usually provide coverage on an all risk form as opposed to a named peril form. For example- a named peril form will list the things you are covered for; fire, wind, hail, theft, vandalism, etc. The High Value companies will say you are covered for Everything except- intentional acts, flood, wear & tear, nuclear, etc. The insurance companies listed above will usually require you insure your home for more than $1,000,000 and have excellent credit. Some will even require an umbrella or jewelry policy to consider."
448,Where  Can  I  Find  Cheap  Auto  Insurance  In  Arkansas?,"Cheap auto insurance in Arkansas is available from many sources. The best way to save money on your car insurance rates is to shop with the help of a broker and their website. Since there are dozens of reputable carriers, unless you have experienced and unbiased help, it may be more difficult to find the best prices. As an experienced broker, we tend to spend a lot of time researching and comparing top-rated companies for consumers. Prices and discounts often change so we always have to monitor many insurers. However, the benefit to consumers is they know they are always viewing the lowest prices."
449,How  Much  Is  Globe  Life  Insurance?,"The price of Globe Life Insurance depends on the type of policy you purchase, your age, gender, and other factors. So it is impossible to state a dollar amount for Globe Life Insurance. While the company offers some good rates, their choices for coverage are not too extensive. So you may want to contact Globe to see what rate you can get, then compare it with other companies using the quote engines provided on many websites."
450,Who  Is  The  Biggest  Life  Insurance  Company?,"The world's biggest life insurance company, measured by assets, is Japan Post Insurance Company, Inc, according to WEBSITELINK The next largest is AXA S. A. (France), then Allianz (Germany). The largest insurance carrier in the United States is MetLife per this chart. Assets were measured 3/2011."
451,Does  Medicare  Pay  For  Echocardiogram?,"Yes! Medicare will cover an echocardiogram. Your doctor must order/prescribe one.An echocardiogram is covered under Medicare Part B. Medicare will pay for about 80% of the costs after the Part B deductible is met ($147 in 2014) - you would be responsible for the other 20% and the Part B deductible. Please note, when you first enroll in Medicare Part B, you open your 6-month initial open enrollment period to buy a Medicare supplement plan (a.k.a. Medigap plan) with NO MEDICAL UNDERWRITING!. A Medigap plan can cover the deductibles and a portion or all of the other 20% of expenses covered by Part B and features a number of other big advantages as well. An experienced broker can help find the plan that's most suitable for you and your budget. Please let me know if I can be of help. Thanks very much."
452,Can  I  Purchase  Life  Insurance  On  My  Parents?,"The answer is it depends. If you are dependent upon your parents for your income and expenses or in business with your parents then yes there is an insurable interest. However, if there is not a clear insurable interest then that answer would be no. If the answer is yes, your parents must be in agreement to purchase life insurance even if you are making the payments. They have to be underwritten and sign the applications and contracts."
453,Who  Pays  For  Social  Security  Disability  Insurance?,"Everyone who pays into Social Security pays for Social Security Disability Insurance. SSDI benefits are funded the same way as Social Security benefits, which is from a payroll tax on all employers, employees, and self-insured workers. They are usually called FICA taxes, and they are managed by the Secretary of the Treasury."
454,Where  Should  I  Get  Term  Life  Insurance?,"The term life insurance market is extremely competitive. Independent life insurance agents with brokerage access should be able to spreadsheet the top companies ranked by premium in each specific health category. Keep in mind that if you under age 50, you can secure up to 30 years of coverage. A 25 year old male nonsmoker seeking ten year term life coverage for $100,000, the premium is less than $100 a year."
455,Why  Does  My  Landlord  Want  Me  To  Have  Renters  Insurance?,"I think that there are two reasons. The landlord wants you to understand fully that he is not responsible for your personal property that is in the rental unit. He is saying, if there is a fire and your things are destroyed, you are responsible, not the landlord. The second reason is liability for personal injury and property damage. If someone is injured in the unit you are responsible and need insurance to protect yourself."
456,What  Factors  Affect  The  Cost  Of  Home  Insurance?,"Several factors impact the cost of your homeowner insurance. Insurance companies can take into consideration all of the following criteria: Insureds age, insurance score, policy type, claims history, supporting policies, coverage limits, age of the home, location, protection class, home updates, your deductible(s), replacement cost or actual cash value on your limits, etc... As you can see, there are many variables that are taken into consideration. And for what it's worth, I would use price as only one factor when considering what insurance policy or agent to go with. If you have five agents/companies quote your insurance, I guarantee you'll have five different quotes. Not all policies are created equal and it is important to understand what value you are getting for your money."
457,Who  Should  Buy  Whole  Term  Life  Insurance?,"Assuming the question is referring to a participating whole life insurance product with a term rider, you need to determine you suitability for such a product and it's design. If you're seeking death benefit coverage, guaranteed universal life may be less in premiums. If your coverage is only temporary, then you should consider term life insurance."
458,Who  Is  Health  Insurance  A  Contract  Between?,"It depends upon whether you are asking about an individual or a group health insurance contract. If you have an individual health insurance policy with an insurance company the contract is directly between you and the insurance carrier. If the coverage is through an employer group then the contract is between the employer and the insurance company, the covered employee does not have a direct contract with the insurance company and has a certificate of coverage outlining the coverage they have through their employer's contract but the employee themselves are not the contract holders."
459,Why  Do  People  Buy  Disability  Insurance?,"People purchase disability to protect the paycheck from periods of sickness and injury. Most Americans only have around 90 days in cash reserves. Even among young people, the average disability period easily exceeds 90 days. Protecting your earning power against these unforeseen events is the primary motivation in purchasing disability insurance."
460,How  Does  It  Work  If  You  Have  Two  Health  Insurance  Policies?,"For someone covered by two or more group health insurance policies, the term COB, short for coordination of benefits, would be used in such a scenario. Group insurance was designed to cover major medical expenses; however, it was never intended to pay in excess of 100% of incurred charges. For this reason,coordination of benefitswas established as a method by which two or more carriers or plans could coordinate their respective benefits so the total benefit paid does not exceed 100% of the total allowable expenses incurred. In most states, thecoordination of benefitsregulations specifies how benefits are to be coordinated by insurance companies issuing group policies in the state. In most states, individual health insurance policies do not have to comply with thecoordination of benefitsrules. Thosepolicies may have special provisions in place if you have more than one policy. You should review your individual health insurance policy to see how it pays if other insurance is involved."

Pneumonia immunizations are also covered by Medicare when administered at participating group clinics, unless you are in an HMO that requires you to go to a certain location to receive your shot in order for Medicare to pay for it."
463,How  To  Sign  Up  For  Medicare  Online?,"The rules of medicare requires the insurance agent to verify you are who you say you are and they must certify that they have interviewed you in a face to face conversation and the agent has to ""recertify"" every year in order to sell medicare advantage and the agent is accountable to assure if you have a ""personal representative"" or a ""power of attorney"" that person has to be present.

If the beneficiary of the life insurance policy is a person, then creditors cannot take the death benefit away from the beneficiary. There may be some exceptions, such as if the beneficiary was a co-signer to the debt."
465,When  Is  It  Too  Late  To  Plan  For  Retirement?,"Procrastination has economic ramifications. But saving something is better than nothing. Here's a few thoughts that can help if you start today.You need to plan on working until you are age 70 and not taking distributions of Social Security or any qualified retirement plans you use now. Social Security distributions are maximized at age 70 and qualified plans require minimum distributions at 70 1/2. So age 70 is the new retirement benchmark, especially if you're late to the game."
466,How  To  Bill  Medicare  As  Secondary  Insurance?,"Your employer group health plan will know. When you receive services, the medical provider will (in most cases) bill the group health plan and Medicare.

After the group plan pays, Medicare will review the balance and pay their portion."
467,Who  Can  Drive  Under  My  Car  Insurance?,"Typically any licensed driver can operate your vehicle and be protected by your insurance policy, as coverage is vehicle primary. However, some policies have reduced coverage for permissive use, sometimes to the state minimum levels of liability. Make sure you read your policy and/or talk to your agent about your specific coverage and state regulations."
468,Does  Short  Term  Health  Insurance  Work?,"STM (short term medical) insurance is real major medical insurance . . . but with some limitations. STM plans do not cover any pre-existing conditions. The application process is simple, usually 5 yes/no questions or less. A ""yes"" answer is an automatic disqualifier. Most STM plans have a simple design of a deductible then coinsurance. A few have copays. Every one I have seen includes an Rx discount plan and some have PPO networks. Benefit periods are on a month to month basis with most plans issuing a maximum of 6 months although a few offer 12 month policies. When the benefit term expires so does your coverage. There is no renewal. Instead you apply for a new plan with new underwriting and new pre-existing limits."
469,Can  My  Health  Insurance  Company  Change  My  Policy?,"No, your carrier cannot change your policy when they want to. The policy is a contract that states you receive coverage in exchange for the payment of premiums. The policy can lapse and subsequently be terminated by the carrier if you don't pay your premiums (when the policy lapses, no coverage is provided) or if you falsify information on your application."
470,How  Much  Does  An  Agent  Make  On  Life  Insurance?,"That is an excellent question! Insurance agents do not draw paychecks like normal people. They are paid a portion of what policies they are able to sell, and that amount is called a ""commission"". The amount of that commission will depend upon the agents' contract with the company, and upon the product that has been sold. There are also small payments made annually called ""residuals"" that are paid when people keep their policies in force over the years. This income can be very lucrative, if you are a good salesperson, and are very active in your sales work. I hope that helps, thanks for asking!"
471,Can  My  Ex  Have  Life  Insurance  On  Me?,"Not only can your ex-spouse buy a life policy on you, but should, particularly if you are paying alimony or child support. Your ex-spouse should apply for and own the policy. Then there is never any question about premium payment and beneficiary changes. Your ex-spouse has a distinct insurable interest. Of course this procedure needs your cooperation. If there are bad feelings you might consider the consequences if the court were to order you to cooperate or buy the insurance for your ex-spouse."
472,How  Much  Should  My  Homeowners  Insurance  Be?,"Homeonwers insurance premiums are as unique as the home being insured.

473,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Legal  Fees?,"If you are sued for bodily injury or property damage, your homeowners policy will provide coverage up to the limits of the policy. In this process they will investigate and settle the claim. They are not required to provide a defense after they have paid an amount equal to the policy limit. This provides coverage for a person who is on your insured premises with your permission and is injured because of a condition on the premises or an activity that involves you, This also covers your domestic employees and animals although there may be limitations to the coverage on dogs. There is also limited coverage for other peoples property that is damaged by you."

475,When  Can  You  Cash  Out  On  Life  Insurance?,"Good question, there are different situations that will allow you to get cash on a life insurance policy.

478,Why  Is  Homeowners  Insurance  Important?,"When you own a home you assume certain risks. One risk is that you are responsible if anyone is hurt on your property. Another risk is that your home could burn or be destroyed in one of several others ways. Under either scenario you loss might exceed your ability to absorb. Perhaps you have taken a mortgage to buy the house and as soon as it is destroyed you must make full payment. These are a couple of the things that a homeowners insurance policy does. In exchange for a premium, the company agrees to handle lawsuits, and repair and reconstruct your home."
479,What  Happens  When  A  Life  Insurance  Policy  Matures?,"Life insurance maturity generally refers to the contract ending point where coverage ends and any cash values are distributed.

480,How  To  Find  Out  How  Much  Life  Insurance  Someone  Has?,"If you are asking about a living, breathing person and you have no ownership in the life insurance policy, then there is no real way for you to find out other than ask them and hope they will tell you. If the person has already died and you are trying to find out if there is life insurance, you should start by looking at their checking account records. A bank draft from a checking account is usually the way it is discovered. The listed beneficiary will be able to get the information from the insurance company once they provide a certified death certificate."
481,Why  Buy  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"You should purchase long term care for your retirement years. The statistics are significant that youll experience a need for assisted living or perhaps nursing home confinement. The average married couple spends $250,000 on medical and extended care during their retirement years. Securing long term care is important, especially when you're healthy and heading into your late fifties, early sixties."
482,Can  I  Be  Denied  Health  Insurance  In  2014?,"Under The Affordable Care Act there will not be any medical underwriting associated with getting a health insurance policy issued.

There are also federal subsidies available that are income-based where you may qualify for government assistance to pay a portion of your insurance premiums."
483,Does  Bank  Of  America  Sell  Life  Insurance?,"I am not an employee of Bank of America but yes just like most banks today they do sell life insurance and annuities. BoA has subsidiary life insurance companies through Merrill Lynch, General Fidelity Life Insurance Company, Meritplan Insurance Company and Newport Insurance Company. Even now some insurance companies now have banks."
484,What  Does  PPO  Stand  For  With  Health  Insurance?,"PPO is a ""Preferred Provider Organization,"" which is a network of doctors, hospitals and other facilities that will offer their services at contractually lower prices to members affiliated with them. Often the discounts are substantial which saves individuals and families hundreds or thousands of dollars. It is a medical care arrangement where the insurers may pay a fee to become part of the actual Network. However, since their charges for procedures and other treatment is reduced, they may gain market share by writing more policies. Most major health insurers offer many PPO plans that help keep premiums low, while providing top-notch treatment and service."
485,What  Does  Renters  Insurance  Usually  Cover?,A renters policy covers your personal property. The limits and exclusions are similar to those in a homeowners policy. The homeowners policy includes the residence. The renters policy covers your personal liability and pays to the limit of the policy for bodily injury or property damage for which you are legally liable. In addition the policy provides medical payments when someone is injured in your rented space.
486,Will  Home  Insurance  Cover  Gas  Leaks?,Homeowners Insurance polices are not maintenance polices so should you develop a gas leak this would be the responsibility of the owner to repair. However in the event a unknown leak caused an explosion and/or fire this would be a covered loss. Youcertainlywould not want this to occur.
487,Will  Obamacare  Raise  My  Medicare  Premium?,"ObamaCare Insurance was to be structured in where the young applicants pay a higher rate than the elder applicants so as to have the young paying a higher premium than would be the case if they could just apply directly to an insurance company for the coverage. That shows what the incompetence level of the ""designers"" of ObamaCare was. We already know we have ""social security"" that was designed where the young would be paying into the system, each required to accumulate 40 quarters of premiums paid, and how many times have the ""legislators"" been required to make adjustments to social security to keep it solvent. As you can see your premiums would depend on where you fall in that scheme-ifyou are young your premiums would ber high, if elder your premiums lower."
488,How  Many  Life  Insurance  Agents  Are  There  In  The  Us?,"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in 2010, which is the most updated information presently available, there were 411,500 insurance agents in the United States. The Bureau projects that over the next 10 year period, employment of insurance agents will grow at about 22%, which is faster than average for other industries."
489,How  Long  Does  It  Take  To  Get  A  Home  Insurance  Binder?,"Under normal circumstances this takes only a few minutes. That doesnt mean that the entire application is completed but the agent usually as authority to extend coverage until the underwriting is completed. A key to prompt binding of coverage is to have the agency needing the binder communicate directly with the agent. For example, the title company should speak directly to the agent that way the binder will meet the specific needs of the borrower and can be handled promptly."
490,Who  Has  The  Cheapest  Life  Insurance  Rates?,"You can run life insurance quotes on numerous websites advertising ""instant life insurance quotes"". These will bring up the cheapest rates for your particular age and sex. Some will even allow you to input some health and other risk factors. Every company has their niche. So this will bring up the cheapest life insurance rates for YOU."
491,What  Is  Better  Term  Or  Whole  Life  Insurance?,"What is better for the person buying the life insurance policy, depends on the need for which the person is buying the policy. If the need is temporary and the applicant is on a limited budget, Term insurance can be a cost effect way to meet a temporary need. Whole Life is excellent for final expense, business succession, and estate planning purposes, because it is sure to be there at the time of death, which is when it is needed."
492,What  Does  A  Medicare  Wellness  Exam  Include?,"The Medicare Wellness Exam occurs after the first 12 months that you have enrolled in Medicare Part B. A Medicare wellness exam includes filling out a risk questionnaire, a review or your medical and family history, developing or updating a list of current providers and prescriptions, height, weight, blood pressure reading, routine measurements, detection of cognitive impairment, personalized health advice, a list of risk factors and treatment options, and setting up a screening schedule."
493,Does  Medicare  Pay  For  Ultrasounds?,"Ultrasounds are covered under Medicare. If they're completed as an inpatient in a hospital, it would be covered by Part A. If they're completed on an outpatient basis, it would be covered under Part B. Medicare typically pays for about 80% of the expenses - you would be responsible for paying the other 20%. A Medicare supplement policy can help pay the remaining 20%."
494,Does  A  401K  Count  As  A  Retirement  Plan?,"Yes, a 401K would count as a retirement plan, but ideally it will be supplemented by other vehicles as part of a complete retirement plan. 401(k)s are qualified plans which means the money goes in pre-tax and is tax-deferred until it is taken out in retirement. 401(k)s limit the amount of contribution and there are penalties if the money is accessed before the age of 59.5. The funds saved in a 401(k) are tax -deferred which is good, but it might not be your best option if you are in a higher tax bracket at retirement. Depending on how your 401(k) is invested, there may be market-risk to be aware of as well. A 401(k) can be an important part of a retirement plan, but it would be best to only contribute up to the company match and use a tax-free option or different vehicle to save above the company match."
495,Does  Home  Insurance  Cover  Ac  Unit?,"Your homeowner's insurance will cover your AC unit if it is a peril included in your coverage. For example, if lightening struck the unit, you would have coverage for the damages. However, if the AC unit stopped working, and it cost $200 to repair, you could not claim that on your insurance."
496,Where  Can  I  Work  Part  Time  And  Get  Health  Insurance?,"Many employers offer part-time job positions. However, often, part-time employees are not eligible for benefits under the master group health insurance plan. It's possible that some employers may have a stripped-down option or you can shop online through a reputable website to find an affordable policy. An experienced broker can easily help you."
497,How  Much  Would  Insurance  Be  For  A  Sports  Car?,There are many factors and unanswered information that is needed. What type of sports car what year and your driving record and what state you are in. I can tell you that I have an insured that has his newerFerrari and is in his mid 40's and is paying less then 200 a month full coverage of course but with 0 deductibles. But he also has and older Ferrari and it had full coverage and pays 200 a year for it with 0 deductible. So to be able to give you a more accurate answer you would need to provide more information
498,How  Hard  Is  It  To  Get  Disability  Insurance?,"How hard is it to get disability insurance? Well let's qualify it this two ways. First is it hard to get a poor disability policy? No, it's really easy and as long as nothing happens to you, you'll never know if was money wasted or not. If something happens however, that's when you find out. The other choice is a good disability policy with a real solid definition of disability that doesn't find ways to reduce or even take away your benefit. Those will be hard to get, underwritten tightly and work fantastic if needed. Why so hard to get? A payout on a disability policy that has that strong definition could pay out into the millions when a COLA rider is attached to it and with the strong definition, a person could still collect while working in another field. The RISK to the insurer is high, so they underwrite tight."
499,Can  I  test  drive  a  car  from  a  private  party  without  insurance?,That is really up to the party that owns the vehicle. If they allow you to drive the vehicle and you do not have insurance and are involved in an accident while driving the vehicle; (they (there insurance carrier)) could be held responsible for any damages during that accident. It would count as a claim on their insurance record and could potential affect there rates in the future.
500,How  Fast  Can  You  Get  Car  Insurance?,Depending on where you get the policy if your purchasing online and understand the coverage's then it may be less then 30 min. I know that our agency can quote with 10 carriers and have a policy issued with in 15 minutes or less. So longs as you have all your information right infront of you most companies can issue a policy with in 15 to 30 minutes max.
501,How  Much  Is  Motorcycle  Insurance  For  A  17  Year  Old?,"It is hard to answer specifically, but safe to say that a 17 year old wil pay more than a 37 year old insuring the same bike, the same way with the same driving history. Similar to car insurance, a younger, less experienced bikler will gelerally pay more than an older more experienced one."
502,How  Does  Life  Insurance  Work  If  Everyone  Dies?,"Another part to this answer is that not all life insurance policies ever pay a death claim. Most life insurance is not designed to be in force when you die unless you die younger than average. Term Life Insurance only pays a death claim if you die while it is in force. That's usually 20-years when you are in your 30's and 40's and often up into your low 60's. But most people don't die that young. Other insurance is tied to your employer and only covers you during your working years. Most people don't die during your working years. So the insurance company gets to keep all those premiums. Whole-life insurance is priced much higher than the others because it will pay a death claim 100% of the time unless you cancel the policy. All insurance is priced based on the likelyhood of it ever paying a death claim. That's why a healthy 35 year old man can buy a million-dollar 20-year term policy cheaper than a 70-year old would pay for a $10,000 whole-life policy. One is very unlikely to ever cost the insurance company anything. The other will certainly be paying a death claim within the next couple decades if not sooner."
503,How  Long  Does  It  Take  For  Renters  Insurance  To  Go  Into  Effect?,"Renters INsurance can go into effect fairly quickly so lon as your insurance professional has binding authority with the company in which the policy is issued. Assuming that to be the case, working with your insurance professional, the application process is really pretty easy and quick. In our case, we could issue a Renter's policy in about 15 minutes."
504,Can  My  Car  Insurance  Sue  Me?,"This is not legal advice. Anytime you intend to defraud a company or an individual you are subject to being sued. For example if you said you were operating your car when it struck a tree when the truth was your brother was driving the car, his license was suspended and you had signed a form excluding him from coverage, you could be sued, particularly if the company had settled the claim before they discovered your deceit."
505,Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  An  IUD?,"Most health insurance plans will cover the cost of an IUD. As part of Obamacare, covered participants are supposed to provide contraceptives at no out of pocket costs to the individual. Covered contraceptives generally include birth control pills, the birth control patch (such as Ortho Evra), a diaphragm, contraceptive gel and an IUD."
506,Does  Medicare  Cover  Home  Care  Assistance?,"Under certain conditions, Medicare Part A will cover intermittent or part-time home health care provided by a skilled nurse. Again, Medicares requirements for receiving home care are quite strict. Medicare will pay for home health care to treat an illness or injury only if a person meetsallof the following requirements: A doctor must determine that medical care is needed at home and must make a plan for such care. The person needs intermittent skilled nursing care, physical therapy, speech therapy, or occupational therapy. The person is homebound, which means generally unable to leave home (when a person leaves, it must be infrequent and for a short time only, such as to go to a doctors appointment). The home health care agency must be Medicare-approved. Keep in mind that unlike Medicares nursing home benefit, a person does not need to be admitted to a hospital first in order to qualify for Medicare home health care. In addition, services will be provided on an intermittent or part-time basis only by a visiting nurse, therapist, or home health aide. Medicares home health care benefit does not pay for 24-hour full-time care. Medicare generally limits its home health care benefit because the program is only designed to serve individuals who need intermittent care for a relatively short period of time rather than care on a daily basis. Once a person is receiving Medicare home health care, his or her plan of care will be reviewed at least every 60 days. If the persons health changes and care is no longer needed, the home health agency will notify the individuals doctor, who must then contact Medicare. From that point, home care will no longer be covered by Medicare. The Medicare home health care benefit will not pay for homemaker services such as housekeeping, shopping, and cleaning. It also does not pay for custodial carethat is, help with meeting daily personal needs such as bathing, toileting, transferring, or eating. Because most people who need long-term care need custodial care, financial practitioners should point out this shortcoming to clients. Many people who do qualify for Medicare home health care benefits still need to pay for additional custodial care in order to live comfortably and independently at home."
507,Can  I  Claim  Homeowners  Insurance  On  My  Taxes?,"This is not an accountants answer. The expense for doing a business can be deducted. If a part of a home is used to conduct a business, or as an in-home office, the percentage of the homeowners premium that would be represented by the space occupied by the business or office could be deducted from your schedule C. You should let your homeowners policy company know that you are conducting a business or keeping a business office on premises. This risk is excluded on most policies. Interestingly there are some businesses that are not excluded; one is piano lessons."
508,What  Do  I  Need  For  Homeowners  Insurance?,"The question is a little vague. If you are asking what do I need to get a price for homeowners insurance, then you will need several pieces of information. You will need to know the year the home was built, the square footage of the home, the physical characteristics of the home and your personal information. If you are asking about coverage, call a local agent and they can help you decide what policy and endorsements are right for you."
509,Is  Life  Insurance  Forbidden  In  Islam?,"Many scholars find insurance unfair. Since there isn't a guaranteed return it has the appearance of gambling. When living in a non-Islamic country, abiding by local law is permissable. In Muslim-majority countries there are alternative companies formed called takaful that provide similar coverages on a shared-risk model."
510,What  Is  The  Purpose  Of  Whole  Life  Insurance?,"The purpose of whole life insurance is to provide guarantees. You know what? It does a very good job at this. Guarantees are a godsend in a financial world in which cycles and ups and downs and cost increases are the norm. Its nice to have a product you can truly count on. These guarantees come in three delicious flavors: Flavor number one: a guaranteed premium. As you get older, your price stays the same. As it costs more for the company to insure you, your price stays the same. If the company has a bad investment year, or two, or three, your price stays the same. Thats good. But theres more. Flavor number two: a guaranteed death benefit. You see all those variables mentioned in number one above that could affect your price but dont? They could also affect your death benefit. But they dont. Neither your age, nor their increasing cost, nor their poor investment performance can reduce the benefit you were leaving to your heirs. That is really good. But we have one last delicious flavor: Flavor number three: a guaranteed cash accumulation. Do yourself a favor and compare the guaranteed growth of cash inside a good whole life contract with other so-called guaranteed investments out there. You will notice that whole life basically beats the pants off the competition in this regard. Of course, you always have to be wise about taking money out of life insurance, and make sure you dont reduce your death benefit to an undesirable amount. But given that, whole life can make a real valuable contribution to the conservative portion of your financial portfolio."
511,How  Do  I  Get  A  Life  Insurance  License  In  Alabama?,"If you have a license in another state, you can apply for a nonresident license in Alabama by using the NIPR (National Insurance Producer Registry). If you are starting your life insurance career in Alabama, you must study for the licensing test, pass it, pay the appropriate fees, and use your life insurance license in Alabama to benefit your life and the lives of others."
512,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Animals?,"There are two parts to this answer because there are two coverages in a tenants policy. Animals are normally not covered as personal property. If your pet dies in a house fire, there probably isnt any recovery. However, if your animal hurts someone other than a household member, there might be coverage if you are legally liable to pay damages. However, you should carefully check your policy as many exclude various breeds of animals and many also limit the amount of liability coverage in the event of an animal related incident."
513,Does  A  Single  Person  With  No  Dependents  Need  Life  Insurance?,A single person has debt and financial obligations and someone has to pay when they die. You will not leave a load of debt on loved once to pay. It better to die in dignity. Get life insurance. How will you expect your remain to be disposed of if you have no life insurance.
514,What  Are  The  Best  Term  Life  Insurance  Companies?,"As far as competitive premiums. I prefer Federal Life, Banner and Trans America. But again, every client's situation may differ on need, current health, past health and budgeted allowance for protection. What is the product being used for is it mortgage protection, income replacement or consumer debt? Are there any dependent children? Many factors in providing the right plan for the right situation."
515,What  Is  Homeowners  Insurance  Binder?,A binder is a one page summary showing the policy is issued or now in force. We use the term the policy is bound and this is where binder comes from. In most cases when a new policy is issued an agent can issue a binder to the insured or lender showing proof of coverage since the actual policy deceleration pages will not be available for several days.
516,What  Does  It  Mean  To  Have  A  Deductible  On  Health  Insurance?,"Think of the deductible as a form of self insurance. In other words, the portion you'll pay before insurance begins to pay on claims. Health plans usually offer a choice of deductibles have a lower premium cost if you choose a higher deductible. A higher deductilbe means you accept more cost upfront for the use of a health plan in order to receive a lower premium cost. After the deductible has been met, usually you go into a phase called ""co-insurance"". Co-insurance is the phase where you and the insurance company split the bill for care. A co-insurance level may be 50-50, 60-40, 70-30 or other combinations depending on your plan. For example if you had a plan with a 80/20 coinsurance provison and a $500 deductible and a bill for $2500 for a service. How it would be split up is as follows. The first $500 of the bill is yours. Of the remaining $2000, the insurance company pays $1600 towards the bill and you have an additional $400. Please note: once you've met your deductible for the year, you will no longer be charged it for claims, Co-insurance would be next. Then once you've met your co-insurance limits, your claims for the balance of the year (not counting copays) are covered at 100%."
517,Does  Federal  Government  Offer  Disability  Insurance?,"The federal government offers two programs Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) that is payroll deducted, so it is classified as an earned benefit and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) that is means tested by income and assets."
518,Will  Medicare  Pay  For  Abdominoplasty?,"Medicare only pays for medically necessary treatments, surgeries, procedures, and medications. Medicare does not cover surgeries that are for cosmetic purposes. Abdominoplasty that is not medically necessary to correct a related to a heath condition, therefore, will not be covered by Medicare. Some Medicare Advantage plans may cover drugs related to having the abdominoplasty done."
519,What  Auto  Insurance  Coverage  Is  Right  For  Me?,In order to determine the right coverage to fit your needs you really need to have a sit down with a local agent who can consult with you on the rightcoverage's. Without giving us any specifics of what we are trying to protect it is impossible to advise you.
520,What  Is  Viatical  Life  Insurance?,The viatical concept is the buying of life insurance policies from the terminally ill. The market grew out of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. The policy-owner transfers ownership of the policy to an entity which pays cash for the policy. The cash is often useful to help with medical bills which can be large for end of life care. The value of the policy is likely greater than its cash surrender value but less than its death benefit. The entity makes a profit on the difference between the sale price and the death benefit they collect when the insured dies. The viatical market evolved into what is now called life settlements where the policies being sold are no longer just involving the terminally ill but also include seniors who have unwanted life insurance policies and desire to get something more than the cash surrender value for them. The financial crisis and miscalculation of life expectancy within the life settlement business caused the investor frenzy of the time to cool sharply several years ago making the transactions less popular today though still viable under idea conditions.
521,Can  You  Cash  In  A  Universal  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Yes, you can cash in a universal life policy. Discuss the ramifications of your decision with your agent, first. If you do cash it in, you can roll the cash value over into a new permanent policy without paying taxes on the cash. To cash it in, you call the company through which it was issued."
522,What  Is  The  Average  Cost  Of  Whole  Life  Insurance?,"All premium quotes are dependent on the final underwriting outcome based on health, gender and age of the proposed insured. Heres an example, more of a rule thumb. Participating Whole Life Insurance purchased as a base policy with no riders is generally 20% over its guaranteed universal life (GUL) counterpart. A 30 year old male nonsmoking with super preferred health covering $100,000 of GUL is averages around $550 annually with the top 25 the leading life insurance companies. The average participating whole life policy should come in around $675 annually. Always check the rate quoted by any online life insurance service to confirm the cost before moving forward."
523,What  Information  Is  Needed  For  A  Home  Insurance  Quote?,"There is a great deal of public information available on the internet about most homes in most locations. At a minimum we would need to know the address of the property. To prepare a quote we would need to know your general description of the home and determine if there were any pets, or trampolines on the property. We would need to know if there were any wood-burning devices inside the home. We would need to know if there had been any claims in the past three years on the property or by the proposed insured. The quote we could give you would not be a guaranteed price as that is done after full underwriting takes place but it is usually quite close."
524,What  Is  A  Group  Universal  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Group universal life is similar to individual universal life. Group policies involve the plan sponsor, often an employer, holding the master policy while the individual participants receive a certificate of insurance. It is a convenient and voluntary way to acquire cash value life insurance through the workplace. Usually the employee pays all premiums in which case all benefits would be immediately and fully vested. At employment termination portability features in these products generally allow for coverage to be taken by the participant as an individual policy."
525,Who  Much  Life  Insurance  Should  I  Have?,"Many people choose to purchase life insurance in amount that is 10 times their annual salary. Some people add up the important things in their lives that would be threatened if they were to pass (e.g. possible loss of home, children being unable to attend the college of their choice) and purchase a policy that would replace the funds needed for those things. If you are purchasing your policy for a specific purpose, such as your funeral or to pay the inheritance taxes on your estate, you can purchase the policy for the anticipated amount. The amount of life insurance you should have varies for each person. Visiting with a good life insurance agent can help you make that determination."
526,What  To  Look  For  When  Buying  Life  Insurance?,"That is a client-specific driven question -- but a good one! It depends on the client's age, health, income, etc. When looking for a carrier, I would look for a carrier that has a strong history and creditworthiness in the life insurance business and rates well on the Standard & Poor's Rating."
527,Does  State  Farm  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Theft?,Whetherit be State Farm or another insurance carrier if you purchased property protection with your renters policy you would be covered for theft on or off yourpremisesminus your deductible. Contact your local agent to discuss any potential theft loss. Also this is a good time to review your policy to make sure youcoverage'sare adequate for ever changing needs.
528,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Garage  Items?,Renters insurance covers any property that you own. If the items are in your garage then they would be covered for any peril covered under your policy. Do not store valuable items in your garage. It is usually much easier to break into a garage than a home.
529,Do  I  Need  Earthquake  Insurance  My  Home?,"A lot depends on the area you live in. Generally, unless you are somewhere like California, earthquake coverage is inexpensive and its not a bad idea to add it if it is not already included. Some companies may require it. Ohio where I live for example, is not know for it's earthquakes however we have had a few relatively minor ones that has caused damage. Unless you are in an area where there is no chance of an earthquake I would recommend it."
530,Who  Qualifies  For  Life  Insurance?,"Because life insurance is all about statistics companies can provide life insurance for individuals in a wide range of health. There are some who cannot obtain coverage because their longevity is in immediate risk, however, many who consider themselves uninsurable actually can obtain coverage. When life expectancy is not very long, the premium for the coverage is going to be quite high."
531,What  Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  In  A  Fire?,"In a fire your homeowners insurance will pay for damage to your personal property, the additional cost of finding alternate temporary lodging and will adjust the claim on the basis of replacement cost if you selected that coverage. If there are liability claims arising out of the fire your liability section will defend and pay awards up to the limits of the policy."
532,What  Is  Protected  Under  Renters  Insurance?,"A renters policy covers damage to your personal property located at the residence. This would include your clothing, furniture and most other things. This coverage has a specified limit. The policy also covers you should you be sued for an occurrence that qualifies for coverage. The suit must be seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage and must not be excluded by other provisions of the policy. This coverage has a specified limit."
533,How  Much  Does  It  Cost  For  Car  Insurance?,"Car insurance rates are based on several variables which are different for everyone. To start, what is your age, what is your driving history? What car are you driving and how much coverage do you want vs. need? Some companies look at your credit score as well. I wish I could tell you exact numbers however as you can see, the range could be inexpensive to pretty costly. Always shop around talking to agents to see what can be offered."
534,Can  Life  Insurance  Be  Contested?,"Life insurance can be contested, but it is very rare for that to succeed. The beneficiary chosen by the owner of the life insurance policy is who they wanted the money to go to, and the policy is a legal contract. It is very important to keep your beneficiaries up to date so that the death benefit goes to the person(s) of your choice."
535,Is  Nursing  Home  Care  Covered  By  Medicare?,"Nursing home care is covered by Medicare in some circumstances. 1. You must stay in a Medicare certified skilled nursing facility. 2. You must enter the nursing home after a qualified inpatient hospital stay of at least three consecutive days (starting with the day you enter the hospital, not counting the day you leave). 3. You must enter the SNF (skilled nursing facility) within 30 days. 4. Your doctor must have ordered the SNF stay due to your need for more than custodial care on a daily basis, and the SNF care must be for something treated during the qualifying hospital stay. 5. Medicare Part A pays for up to 100 days of nursing home coverage."
536,What  Is  A  Life  Insurance  Quote?,"Great question. Insurance lingo can be very confusing, especially when shopping and trying to compare prices. Here are a few words that can cause some confusion, and how us agents usually mean them. 1. QUOTE = the price we think you will get based on what you told us. If you are looking for a medically underwritten policy and were not asked many health details, chances are that quote is not very accurate. You can also tell if someone is following a script. There are so many nuances in each person's situation, that if you find an agent who quotes you more by experience and knowledge than ""if a, then b"", my opinion is that you will get a more accurate quote and end up with a better rate. 2. RATE = the price you actually end up paying. Another word is PREMIUM. This is your cost after all the underwriting has been done and your final rate has been determined by the insurance company. 3. RATING = this refers to the health rating. Examples are Preferred, Standard, Table C. It is what you are rated after the underwriter reviews all your health information. I hope that helps. Feel free to contact me or post any more questions you might have."
537,When  Is  Someone  Eligible  For  Medicare  Part  D?,In order to qualify for Part D the applicant has to be covered by both Part A and Part B coverages and live in the County designated by the Plan. So if someone has a Medicare card that shows they were eligible for both Part A and Part B on 11/1/2013 then they are qualfied to buy a Part D plan
538,Can  I  Use  My  Health  Insurance  In  Another  State?,"You can use your health insurance in another state, it just depends on whether it will be considered in or out of network. If it is an emergency, most companies willtreat it as an I network claim. If it is for a random MD visit, then it will most likely be treated as out-of-network"
539,Why  Should  I  Rollover  My  401K?,"The reason many people rollover their 401 k plans is generally to have better control over the account if you are leaving that company. Also you have better control rather than having to contact the old imployer. You may get a getter return on your 40l k with a different investment firm,"
540,Do  You  Need  A  License  To  Sell  Life  Insurance  In  Maine?,"Peggy is 100% correct, of course- but I'd like to just give a tip- get a Life and Health license. The population in Maine is pretty sparse- and if you are new to the field you may want to expand your portfolio of products instead of concentrating in just a specific type of insurance."
541,How  Much  Is  Disability  Insurance  For  Doctors?,"Any disability insurance policy is priced based on several factors of the applicant. These include age, gender, occupation and duties of that occupation, tobacco use, and the amount of coverage needed or desired. The amount of coverage is often dictated by the person's earned income; the more someone earns, the more coverage that is available. There are several policy design features that can be included in the plan (or not) that will also affect the price. The person's medical history can also play an important role in pricing. As you can see, there are lots of moving parts to a disability policy that will affect the price. Doctors often buy coverage to protect their specific medical specialty. Best to discuss this important insurance coverage with a knowledgeable professional."
542,Can  Tricare  Be  Primary  Over  Medicare?,"Tricare is never primary over Medicare. It will only pay after all other insurances have paid. If you have Tricare and are entitled to Part A, you must have Part B to continue the Tricare pharmacy benefits. However you do not have to enroll in a Part D prescription plan. If you do choose to enroll in a Part D plan, Tricare will be secondary to that plan as well."
543,What  Is  An  HSA  Health  Insurance  Plan?,"An HSA is a Health Savings Account. If your employer offers it as a benefit, you should take advantage of it. It allows you to have available for medically related needs, a set limit of pre-taxed money which is typicallyset aside for you through a payroll deduction. Medical needs for which the HSA funds can usually be available are: doctor, visits, physicals, surgery, eye-glasses, prescriptions, etc."
544,What  Is  The  Age  Limit  For  Health  Insurance?,"The age to remember with health insurance is 26. Under the Affordable Care Act, children can stay on their parent/guardians health insurance until the age of 26 regardless of marriage status or enrollment in school. After the age of 26, the person must obtain their own insurance. Those under age 30 can obtain catastrophic insurance coverage for lower premiums than other ACA-compliant policies. With a catastrophic plan, preventive care is covered, but the individual is responsible for 100% of the cost up to the out-of-pocket maximum, which is $6,350 for individuals."
545,How  To  Find  A  Registered  Investment  Advisor?,Generally speaking a registered representative is restricted on advertising. Firms that are known to handle securities probably have one or more registered representatives. Some life Insurance agents are also registered representatives. If an organization deals in mutual funds they would have registered representatives as well.
546,Who  Can  Cash  Out  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Only the owner of a life insurance policy can cash it out, which of course means surrender it, and terminate its coverage. This leaves you with no life insurance. A far better thing to do would be to borrow against it, which you can only do with Whole Life Insurance, never term, whish has no surrender or cash out value. If you instead borrow against it, the policy stays in force, with a diminished death benefit, but you can always repay the loan and return to the full death benefit, which will have grown, since it grows even as if the loan had not taken place, due to accumulation. To get the major part of the death benefit however you do have to repay the loan when the emergency is past. Talk to an experienced agent. Gary Lane, Registered Representative and Agent, New York Life. 949 797 2424. Thank you."
547,Can  One  Person  Have  Two  Life  Insurance  Policies?,"Yes, one person can have two or more life insurance policies. Many people buy a variety of policies because different types of products best meet different types of needs, or simply because they want to diversify the companies with whom their life insurance is with. Insurance companies do not mind how many policies you have, as long as you can qualify for them financially."
548,What  Will  Be  The  Medicare  Premium  In  2014?,"No one knows yet, what the Medicare premium will be for Part B in 2013. The projection of the average premium for Medicare Part D in 2014 is $31/month, which is just $1/month higher than it has averaged for the past three years. The Medicare Part B premium in 2013 is $104.90/month for those with modest incomes."
549,When  To  Start  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,Conventional wisdom is no later than age 50 when the potential morbidity events begin to increase and at age 62 for price considerations. Establishing a long term care insurance policy is part of defensive retirement planning and should be a high priority based on life expectancy and the average cost fo extended care during your senior years.
550,How  Do  I  Qualify  For  Medicare  In  Wyoming?,"To qualify for Medicare in Wyoming, you must be age 65 and have paid into Social Security taxes for 40 quarters (10 years) over your working life, or you must have/had a spouse who did so.

551,Who  Should  Get  Disability  Insurance?,"The ideal person that needs disability insurance is the person that's most valuable asset is their ability to earn a living. If someone needs a steady paycheck in order to pay their normal living expenses, this is a prime candidate for disability insurance. You are 8 times more likely to become disabled from an injury or illness than to die."
552,Where  Is  The  Cheapest  Renters  Insurance?,There is not enough information here to answer this question with any certainty. Rates for renters insurance can vary greatly from carrier to carrier and area to area. There are many factors that go into determining the rate that you pay for the coverage that you are seeking. To find the best rate for the coverage that you are seeking within your area I would suggest calling a few local agents to find out about availability of coverage and pricing.
553,Can  Life  Insurance  Go  To  A  Trust?,"Yes. A trust can be very advantageous depending on the reason for the trust and the type of trust. For example, you can use a Funeral Trust as a way to pre-fund your funeral and protect your life insurance from Medicaid spend down. An experienced agent can look at your individual situation and help determine if a trust would benefit you."
554,What  Is  The  Penalty  For  Not  Having  Health  Insurance  Under  Obamacare?,"The penalty for people who can afford health care but do not have health insurance under the Affordable Healthcare Act is a fee. The fee is called the ""individual mandate"" or ""the individual responsibility payment"". This is being assessed in one of two ways. The first is 1% of your yearly household income and the maximum penalty is the cost of a bronze plan. The second way is $95 per person in a family and half that, $47.50 per child, with the maximum penalty being $285 for a family. The fee will be collected from the 2014 household income which will be completed in 2015 from the income tax form. If the wages are too low then the person or family may be entitled to a waiver. The fee will increase every year with the next increase in 2015 to 2.5% of your yearly household annual income or $695 per adult."
555,How  To  Get  Quotes  For  Homeowners  Insurance?,"You could call insurance agents within your area for a start. Whe you call please have the following information available. Normally a requires the year of construction of the home, the square footage of the home, type of garage (if any), any decks or porches, basement type (if any), architecture type of the home,distance of the nearest responding fire department, and possibly more."
556,Is  Life  Insurance  Taxed  When  Paid  Out?,"No, life insurance is not taxed when paid out, in most cases. There are some exceptions, such as when the beneficiary is the estate; then the life insurance benefit will be subjected to the same taxes as the rest of the estate. If eligible by virtue of amount, life insurance be subject to estate tax. By and large, however, life insurance is not taxed when paid out, making it a very favorable gift to those who receive it."
557,How  Much  Is  Full  Coverage  Auto  Insurance  In  California?,"Full coverage is always a dangerous term. Most people consider full coverage as having comprehensive a collision coverage's on their vehicle. However this would leave out medical, rental reimbursement, towing and possible more options. With that said the coverage is not actually full. With this question being a blanket question it is actually impossible to answer without a series of questions being asked first such as location, age of operator, marital status, driving history and driving record not to mention type of car. I highly suggest you contact a local agent who can quote you multiple companies to find you the best coverage's and rates to fit your needs."
558,Can  You  Apply  For  Medicare  Part  B  Online?,"You can apply online for Medicare Part B. You can accomplish this in different ways. You can go directly to the Social Security website and complete the short online paperwork. You can also go (in person) to a Social Security office in your area. Typically, it should not be far away. You can also call (800) 772-1213. And of course, working with an experienced broker with the help of a reputable website will also make the process much easier. Don't worry. Brokers don't charge fees."
559,How  Much  Should  I  Have  In  Annuities?,"Product suitability dictates whether you should purchase a non-qualified annuity or not. You first need to establish a personal financial profile that includes a risk tolerance assessment, defined financial goals, an estimate of your life expectancy and a determination of your effective tax bracket. This will assist you in your product suitability self-examination."
560,Can  Car  Insurance  Go  On  Your  Credit  Report?,"I hope I understand your question correctly. I'm assuming you're asking if an insurance company getting your insurance score will show up on your credit report and affect your credit score. In general, no. I can only speak for my own state of Michigan but I'm pretty sure other states work the same way. An insurance score is different from a credit score. There are many different models to calculate an insurance score and different companies will use different models. When an insurance company orders an insurance score it won't affect your credit score like applying for a loan will. If it shows up at all, it will show up as an insurance score and won't be used to calculate your credit score. So, don't be worried if your agent asks for information to order an insurance score. It's usually one of the largest discounts that a company will offer."
561,I  am  moving  across  country.  What  are  my  options  to  insure  my  property  during  transit,"If you have a homerowners/renter/condo policy in force at the time the property is in transit, then there could be some coverage extended from that policy. With the carriers I represent, most cover 10% of the contents limit ""off premisis"". This means if you had a policy with $100,000 in contents coverage, there could be $10,000 of coverage in a situation like this. I have one carrier who provides 100% of the policy contents limit anywhere in the world. Ifthere is no policy in force while the property is in transit, check with the moving company to see what options they have available. Most all policies have specific language to property ""off-premisis"" so most definately call your local independent agent and ask the specific amount your policy provides for the situation you descirbed."
562,What  Does  PCN  Stand  For  On  A  Health  Insurance  Card?,"PCN stands for Processor Control Number. In short, this is one of the identifcation codes related to your prescription drug plan that the pharmacy needs to determine if the prescription will be covered under your drug plan and how it would be paid, if covered. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your coverage and if you have any further questions. Thanks very much."
563,How  Much  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Is  Enough?,"Every financial product purchase has a value proposition, including long term care. Based on all the present gerontology statistics and ever increasing life expectancy, youll want to secure the maximum coverage for the longest period. Keep in mind that this includes the convention nursing home confinement our parents knew as well as todays popular assisted home living."
564,What  To  Look  For  When  Buying  Renters  Insurance?,You should first look for a competent agent. Get referrals from reliable friends. Friends who have experienced a loss are frequently the most informed. Setting coverage limits is critical as this will determine how the company protects you in the event of a loss. Make sure that the agent provides accurate information to the company and to you. Make sure that you are comfortable with the agent and his or her office staff.
565,How  Much  Is  Health  Insurance  Through  A  Job?,"At this point in time within the United States the cost of your health insurance coverage purchased thru an employer can vary greatly depending on the carrier, the coveragesprovided, the number of people enrolled in the plan, and the health histories of the participants. Many employers demand that the carrier they work with allow thier employees more than one option when it comes to the plans offered."
566,How  Much  Is  Individual  Health  Insurance  In  New  Jersey?,"It varies from person to person. Your age, where you live, if you use tobacco products, and if you qualify for a subsidy to reduce your premium will determine how much a good policy is going to cost. Under the Affordable Care Act, you have the options for bronze, silver, gold, and platinum level plans (as you go up in metal, the price goes up, but provides better benefits) - some areas also have a catastrophic plan available. In addition, your age is a big factor as well. The younger you are, the cheaper your premium - the older you are, the higher your premium. Also, if you use tobacco products, your premium can be increased up to 50% as well. All of the plans offer good coverage. A silver or gold plan are your middle of the road type of plans because they provide strong coverage at an affordable price. I always recommend consulting with an experienced health insurance broker before you apply for anything. We can help you determine the plan that's going to be most suitable for your needs and budget. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
567,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  A  Lost  Wedding  Ring?,"Not if the ring is not ""scheduled"" specifically for coverage as a rider to your Homeowners' policy. Homeowners covers your belongings for specific perils, as listed in the contract. If an item is ""lost"" or ""mysteriously dissappears"", these unfortunately are not covered perils in a Homeowners policy. If the ring is scheduled on a rider or insured separately on it's own such policy, then the lost ring's replacement would be covered."
568,Does  Life  Insurance  Require  A  Blood  Test?,"It depends on the amount applied for and the applicant's age. The older the applicant, the smaller the amount applied for that triggers the requirement for a blood profile. Along with a blood draw, a urine specimen may be a part of the underwriting requirement. The insurance company usually pays for the test."
569,Does  The  Car  Insurance  Cover  The  Driver  Or  The  Car?,"The rule of thumb with auto insurance is, it follows the driver first and the vehicle second. If you are driving a vehicle that is not yours your auto insurance will typically provide coverage for the accident first and then if the claim exceeds your coverage a claim could also be charged against the vehicle owners auto insurance coverage."
570,How  To  Purchase  Medicare  Insurance?,"Being a broker, I'd say the best way to buy Medicare is by using a broker. Actually, you'll get Part A & B from the government. But drug coverage as well as supplemental coverage is purchased separately. I suggest using a broker to purchase any type of insurance for this reason. Insurance is quite involved - and there are a lot of moving parts. You can learn 100% about Medicare, but probably only 2% relates to you. The other 98% is exceptions or situations that don't relate to you. A broker will ask you a few questions so you only have to deal with the 2% that relates to you."
571,How  Long  Can  Children  Be  On  Parents  Health  Insurance?,"Children can be on their parents' health insurance plans until they are 26 years old. However, it may be more cost effective at a certain point before then to have them go on their own individual plan or group plan through their employer if they are employed. You should consult with an experienced health insurance broker regarding your family's insurance plan benefits and costs to determine the if there is a more suitable program for your family's specific needs. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
572,Is  Secure  Horizons  A  Medicare  Supplement?,"Secure Horizons is a senior market insurance carrier. They offier Medicare advantage AND medicare supplements so you can choose what suits you best. You should know Medicare ranks carriers and plans by a star system.

574,Which  Medicare  Part  B  Plan  Is  Best?,"The government originally established Medicare with two parts. Part A to cover hospitals and part B to cover outpatient services. Both of these are administered by the Medicare (CMS) and there is no choice of coverage. Later Part D was initiated to cover prescriptions. These plans called PDP's are administered by private insurance companies. Part C, Medicare Advantage Plans are plans that are administered by private insurance companies instead of Medicare. As far as which plan is best, that will depend on your individual situation; where you live, what doctors and hospitals you go to, do you travel outside the area a lot,what your prescriptions are, and other factors. Find a good independent agent who represents most of the Medicare plans in your area and have the agent help you with your choice. You can also find information at Medicare.Gov."
575,How  Many  Employers  Offer  Disability  Insurance?,If your employer offers a company sponsored group benefit plan the odds are that you have short term disability coverage. But check with your human resources department to confirm. The majority of businesses do not offer individual disability insurance to the rank and file employees. Thats generally reserved as a recruiting and retaining key employees.
576,What  Types  Of  Jobs  Offer  The  Best  Health  Insurance  Coverage?,"What type of jobs offer the best health insurance? Well it depends. The choice for an employer prior to the ACA to provide health insurance was completely voluntary and any size business might offer quality benefits. Sometimes assuming a large employer offers the best plans could be a mistake. Often better benefits than average were offered by businesses that needed to attract and retain quality employees. The high tech field because of demand,offered great benefits to employees to help keep the best employees there. With the ACA things will change considerably for business that uses health benefits to attract employees. The Cadillac tax on employers who provide too ""good"" of benefits for their employees will reduce health benefits to a national standard that a business would be forced to pay extra taxes in penalty if they wanted to do more for their employees."
577,What  Is  A  Good  Renters  Insurance  Policy?,"Suggest that you contact two independent agencies in reasonable proximity to your residence and ask them to get you quotes from several of the most well-known National insurance carriers, including but not limited to: Hartford, Travelers, Met and Safeco. That will give you a good idea of how to proceed."
578,How  Long  Should  You  Have  Term  Life  Insurance?,"The length of time needed for a term life insurance actually depends on the reason the policy was purchased. If the policy was purchased to insure a debt and the debt is repaid, then the policy may need to be cancelled. If the policy was purchased to replace income and the need is still present, then the policy should be left in force or reviewed to be changed if need be,"
579,What  Does  Medicare  Supplement  F  Cover?,"Medicare Supplemental Plan F covers 100% of what Medicare doesn't cover. Keep in mind, when you have Supplemental (AKA Medigap) Plans, Medicare is your primary insurance provider. For medically necessary procedures, Medicare Parts A (Hospital) and B (Doctors) provides good coverage, but still leaves folks on Medicare with a lot of out of pocket exposure. The Plan F pays for everything that Medicare doesn't pay. However, if Medicare determines that the medical procedure you received wasn't medically necessary, they won't pay anything nor will the Supplement Plan (regardless of who you get your supplemental plan with)."
580,Does  Life  Insurance  Money  Go  Into  Estate?,One can certainly make the beneficiary their estate. I do not recommend it. The proceeds can be tied up in a probate and in some cases taxed along with assets. It is much cleaner and beneficial to name a beneficiary versus leaving it to an estate. Always seek the advise of a good estate planning attorney in your state.
581,What  Is  Servicemen  Group  Life  Insurance  Coverage?,"That is a great question! Regular life insurance companies will not insure anyone that is in the military, or in an area where military action is likely. Insurance companies are all about the risk of loss, and being in the military greatly increases that risk. As a result, the federal Government offers life insurance for the members of the military, so that their families can be protected also. That is what Servicemen Group Life is. I hope that helps. Thanks for asking!"
582,Why  Buy  Supplemental  Disability  Insurance?,"There are several reasons to considering buying Supplemental Disability Insurance. 1) Group Disability policies usually pay 60% of your income in event of disability, and if your employer paid the premiums, the benefits are taxed. Thus, the benefit you actually receive may be approx 45% of your income. Supplemental Disability Insurance is not taxed and can possibly raise this benefit to 70% to 80% of your income. 2) Any group benefit will be lost when you leave the group. Having Supplemental Disability Insurance can be valuable if you no longer qualify for Disability Insurance upon separating from a job and its group benefits. 3) Group Disability coverage is often ""own occupation"" the first two years, then changes so that you will no longer receive your benefits if you can work at ANY job, not just your OWN type of job.

583,Can  I  Get  Health  Insurance  Without  A  Physical?,"Yes.

584,Does  My  Renters  Insurance  Cover  My  Cell  Phone?,A cell phone is covered as personal property under a renters policy.

587,Does  Whole  Life  Insurance  Ever  Really  Make  Sense?,"There are a lot of answers here which are all correct so I will take a little different approach. Asking the question When does Whole Life make sense is really talking about your situation. If you are looking to protect your family while the children are at home, then Whole Life may not be the best solution or if you have a loan such as your mortgage, Whole Life may not makes sense. However, if you are looking for Lifetime Coverage with not only a death benefit guarantee, because I can give you a death benefit guarantee for a lot less, but a guaranteed cash value to use as necessary in the future years. Whole Life is also used in some type of plans for businesses which is required to be fully guaranteed as well."
588,Why  Is  Life  Insurance  So  Cheap?,"Term life insurance is cheap because it only pays out if death occurs during that period of time. The lower the age, the lower the actuarial risk of passing away, the lower the price. To get a policy that will be assured to be there to the end of life, the premium may be reasonable, but not necessarily ""cheap"". Knowing it will be there for your loved ones at the time of need can definitely make it worth the cost. That is not to say there is not a need for cheap term life insurance. Thankfully, both Term and Permanent policies are available so that coverage is available and affordable for nearly anyone who wants it."
589,Does  Virginia  Require  Renters  Insurance?,As of this date and to the best of my knowledge renters insurance is not required in any state. A landlord may through the rental agreement require any tenant to carry renters insurance. Renters insurance is typically very low cost and can provide protection when you need it. With renters insurance you not only cover your personal property but also adds liability coverage in the event that someone is hurt while at your residence.
590,How  Much  Does  Medicare  Cover  For  Glasses?,"Medicare does not pay for routine eye exams or corrective lenses. But if you have vision issues, such as glaucoma or cataracts, Medicare will cover at least a portion of your treatment. Medicare will pay for some of the cost of eyeglasses following cataract surgery. Your Medicare approved supplier that accepts assignment can tell you how much the Medicare allowance is for your eyewear."
591,How  Do  You  Determine  How  Much  Term  Life  Insurance  You  Need?,"There will be a range of answers in the calculation. Are you married? Do you have kids? Are they going to college? Do you own a home? Have a mortgage? What is your income and prospective income over the next few years? Does your spouse have a career of their own, making a good income? How much do you participate in the family income? The broadest answer is from 2 to 10 times your annual income. Use these factors to calculate the more precise amount. thank you. GARY LANE."
592,Can  You  Cancel  Life  Insurance?,"Yes you can cancel your life insurance. However, if it is term insurance (also called temporary) it will be money lost and no policy will remain. With whole life or permanent, you may stop paying but continue the policy from the equity you may have accumulated. Or borrow against that equity, never having to repay it, keeping it tax free, while the policy remains in effect. But yes, even here, if it is what you want, you could cancel the whole life policy, getting the cash surrender value to keep, but it would be taxable and your policy would be ended. Thank you. GARY LANE"
593,Will  I  Be  Taxed  If  I  Don't  Have  Health  Insurance?,"Beginning in 2014, under the new affordable care act, everyone will have to have health insurance or pay a penalty (also known as an ""individual shared responsibility payment""). If you choose to pay the penalty instead of securing coverage, you will still be responsible for 100% of your medical care. The penalty is calculated in one of two ways (you pay whichever is the higher amount). In 2014, the penalties will be calculated as: 1) 1% of your yearly household income featuring a maximum penalty as the national average yearly premium for a bronze plan. 2) $95 per person for the year (If under age 18, then $47.50) featuring a maximum penalty per family of $285 under this method. The penalty calculations will change each year. In 2015, method one increases to 2% of your yearly household income and method two increases to $325 per person. In 2016, it will increase again to 2.5% for method one and $695 per person for method two. The penalty methods will be adjusted for inflation in later years."
594,What  Is  Medicare  Fee  For  Service  Contractor?,"Medicare is a fee for service program. A doctor or hospital can agree to accept Medicare patients and thus contract with Medicare to accept the rules and conditions imposed by Medicare, or they can opt out of the Medicare program, in which case a medicare patient would be responsible for payment if they go to that doctor or the doctor can simply refuse Medicare patients. The same is true for hospitals or other facilities."
595,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Gun  Theft?,"Renters insurance will cover theft of personal property, including your firearms, up to the personal property limit, less deductible. If your firearm is more expensive, or an antique, you may want to consider adding either firearms coverage, or increasing the amount of personal property coverage you have on your policy to ensure it is covered."

All other coverage and limits are optional. However I highly recommend Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist coverage. This protects You if the person who hits you doesn't have insurance or enough insurance to cover Your damages. Go to WEBSITELINK for more information and some free quotes!"
599,Can  I  Have  Private  Insurance  And  Medicare?,"Yes, people who have Medicare part A & B can also have a Medigap Plan (or Medicare Supplement Insurance). A Medigap Plan covers what original Medicare Part A & B does not such as co-insurance, deductibles and co-pays. These plans are offered through private insurance companies. The best way to compare Medigap Plans is to contact an independent agent that can you show you quotes from all the major private insurance carriers."
600,Why  You  Should  Buy  Disability  Insurance?,"You should buy Disability Insurance if you have an income that would be entirely lost if you were unable to work at all for a short or long period of time. If your job is specialized and it would be very difficult for you to work or make a living at an alternative job, you could get Disability Insurance that covers your ""own occupation"" so that you do not find yourself working at something that makes you miserable for the rest of your life."
601,Who  Can  I  Add  To  My  Auto  Insurance?,"If you get married, then you can add your spouse and their car to your policy. If you and your spouse are parents and your kids become licensed drivers, then you can add them to your policy. Generally speaking if you have another relative who is residing with you, they can be added to your car policy as well. If you have a resident nanny for your younger children, and that person will have regular use of your car, then it is properto add that person to your policy as well."
602,Can  You  Cancel  A  Whole  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Well, yes, you can. Speak to your insurance professional about the pros and cons of cancelling before you decide, however. Keep in mind that depending on the contract, if by surrendering the policy you receive any cash proceeds that may have built up in the policy while it was in force, this could trigger a taxable event. That is why it is a good idea to speak with your professional agent and weigh you options carefully before choosing the course that best suits your needs."
603,How  Much  Does  Auto  Insurance  Increase  After  Speeding  Ticket?,"Most insurance companies will give you one speeding ticket, in fact since most companies only do periodic checks, they may not know about the ticket right away. The effect on your rates should be minimal if at all. This varies by company however so check with your local agent. Do not call the insurance company to ask them directly however. That phone call could result in a check and depending on the company, could result in an increase if you have more than the one incident on your record or you are getting a discount for a perfect driving record."
604,When  Is  Car  Insurance  Going  Down?,"This question is way too vague to be able to provide a decent answer to. As none of have a crystal ball readily available, the best I can suggest is that depending on your carrier, the losses that they have experienced over the last five years, and the make up (age, sex, etc.) of their client base you may experience a decrease in premium at any renewal then again you may experience an increase in premium also."
605,Is  Disability  Insurance  Recommended?,"Yes, it is highly recommended. Unless you have significant savings set aside for 30 months or so, you may need to consider disability insurance. The average disability can run 30 months. Most working Americans have 90 days in cash reserves. Is it important to have a paycheck coming in? Disability insurance is paycheck protection."
606,Why  Is  Whole  Life  Insurance  So  Expensive?,"Why is whole life so expensive? Because it is the ONLY product that really will cover you for your whole life. You are paying a premium that is LOCKED in time, they can't come back and raise the price. Finally, when you buy whole life, YOU control the policy. Nothing can be done without your permission. I guess I would add this, the insurance industry is an industry of math. It is statistic driven and risk oriented. If you were an insurance carrier would you charge the least or the most for the product you bare the most risk from for payout? Once an insurance company has sold a whole life, they're no longer in charge, the insured is."
607,Who  Should  Own  Your  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"In Canada, you can own a policy on anyone you have an insurable interest in (with their permission) including yourself. If your company owns the life insurance on your life and the company is not the beneficiary. It would be considered a taxable benefit. With one exception transfer of ownership is considered a deemed disposition. In other words it could trigger a taxable gain. The Income Tax Act provides for the transfer of a policy to the policyowners child, without a taxable disposition to the policyowner, if a child of the policyowner is the only person insured. Child includes any natural or adopted child, grandchild, stepchild, son- or daughter-in-law. THAT ONE EXCEPTION creates a planning opportunity. Does it make sense to keep paying income tax each year on the growth of your non-registered investments? Use non-registered assets you wont need during your lifetime. Buy an exempt permanent life insurance policy. Structure the policy to: enable tax-efficient distribution of your assets to future generations and give you control and access while living. Growth inside a permanent life insurance policy is not subject to annual tax (within limits) and Proceeds of life insurance go to named beneficiaries tax-free. Example: How it works: You own the policy. Your adult child is the insured person, Your grandchild is the beneficiary While living, Your adult child is contingent owner At your death, Your adult child becomes owner of policy Benefits for you Taxes - Reduce your annual income tax Control - Keep control of your assets - Can change beneficiary and coverage amount (subject to underwriting requirements) - Can access the cash value in the policy if necessary Legacy - Preserve your legacy for your children and grandchildren - Generate estate value, not taxable income If you have further questions, or feel that I could be of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me. If you would like to work with a local life insurance broker, you could start with a Google search. For example, if you search for: life insurance broker Halifax or life insurance agent Halifax, my name, along with several others, will come up. You can use the same method to find a life insurance broker in your community."
608,What  Is  A  Medicare  Replacement?,Original Medicare has been in existence since 1965 when Lyndon Johnson signed the bill making it law. Original Medicare had Part A (hospital) and Part B (doctor and outpatient). Almost immediately a few carriers saw an opportunity to market supplemental coverage to pick up the gaps left by Medicare. Medicare Part C (later called Medicare Advantage) began in 1997. These private insurance plans gave seniors an option for a managed care private plan vs original Medicare.
609,How  Much  Is  Life  Insurance  For  My  Parents?,"Determining the price of life insurance for your parents depends on their age, health, and what type and amount of life insurance you are looking for. Most of the people who contact us for life insurance for their parents are looking for small final expense policies. This type of policy can usually be obtained with no exam and is Whole Life so that it will not end before death occurs. We also sell level premiums, meaning that the policy will not go up in price. Otherwise, there is a risk that the policy will become too expensive to hang onto until death occurs. For this type of policy, the price is approx $100/mo for a 60 year old man buying a $15,000 Whole Life policy that will not go up in price for the rest of his life. If there is a serious health condition, this price can be much higher, and rates will be substantially higher if the applicant is much older. Of course prices are lower if your parent is younger, and there are scores of other factors to consider. An agency that specializes in Senior Life Insurance can be helpful to find your parents life insurance that does what you want it to at the best possible price."
610,Who  Sells  Term  Life  Insurance?,"Term life insurance is sold by agents who work alone from home or in a small office, agencies that employ several to many agents, online agents and agencies, mailers, and some life insurance companies that sell it direct to the consumer online. You can buy Term Life Insurance in many places. The key is to make sure you are medically qualified and getting the best price. To do that, it is best to go through an agent."
611,Who  Can  Purchase  Life  Insurance?,"Anyone who can prove insurable interest between the insured and the beneficiaries as well as justify the amount of coverage may apply for life insurance coverage. The second condition is your health condition. Life insurance is a mortality product. Your premium will be a function of your health, the healthier the insured, the lower the premium."
612,"My  Agent  Told  Me  I  Was  Covered  For  Prenatal  Care,  But  Now  I'M  Pregnant  And  Found  Out  I'm  Not  Covered  For  Anything  Maternity  Related.  What  Do  I  Do?","If you were missled by your insurance ""professional"" then you can recieve financial indemnification. It does not matter if the information that you were provided was provided in good faith, or if you were intentionally misled. Generally all Life/Health Agents/Brokers must have at least $1,000,000 (per incedent) in Errors and Omissions Coverage to protect them from this type of situation. The best way for you to proceed would be to contact your State's Department of Insurance, there should be a toll free number on their website and an option that will direct you to consumer protection and assistance."
613,Who  Sells  The  Cheapest  Auto  Insurance?,"There are many carriers out there all can be quite ""Cheap"" But be careful when shopping for rates cheap doesn't always mean you have the proper coverage. Also depends on what type of coverage you are looking for. When shopping online there are times that the rate is fantastic then you find out that they are not even allowed to sell insurance in your state. you also have to think about in the event of a claim can they be reached and you talk to someone local? Buyer beware make you are covered properly like the old saying goes if it is to good to be true then most likely that is the case. However I do have some carries that I have a client in that has full coverage on a car and only $143 for 6 months of coverage with low deductible now that is cheap but her coverage is not. So the key is making sure you know what you are purchasing before you put the money out. A Local agent or the States insurance commissioners office can assist you in finding what you are looking for"
614,What  License  Do  I  Need  To  Sell  Disability  Insurance?,"The license needed for disability is a health insurance license. However, something just to consider, go ahead and get both your life and health insurance license. You will find that most clients in need of disability also will need life insurance and vice versa. Also, some states will not grant you reciprocity unless you have both your life and health license. You may wish to cross license in other states as you grow your practice and this will become an issue. It really doesn't cost much more or take too much more of your time to carry both license together. Good luck!"
615,Can  I  Get  Health  Insurance  If  Unemployed?,"Your employment status does not effect your eligibility for individual health insurance coverage. The important question is how long have you been unemployed? With the closing of the 2015 open enrollment period on February 15th an individual has to experience a ""change of life status event"" in order to enroll for coverage before next year's open enrollment period. Loss of group health insurance coverage from a previous job is a change of life status event. You have 60-days after a change of life status event to enroll in individual coverage. You should have the option of enrolling directly with a major medical insurance carrier in your state or through the government health insurance marketplace. It should be noted that if you have recently lost employer based health insurance you should have the ability to continue your coverage through your former employer's group health plan for some period of time. This will vary depending upon your state of residence and the size of your employer. If you worked for a company with 20+ employees they are subject to the Federal COBRA continuation guidelines and you could continue your coverage through them for up to 18-months as long as you pay the entire monthly premium in a timely manner. You have 63-days after termination of employment to exercise your COBRA continuation privilege. If you worked for a company with less than 20 employees then state continuation rules would apply and these do vary from state to state."
616,Can  I  Add  My  Elderly  Parent  To  My  Health  Insurance?,"No. The only people who can be added to your health insurance is your spouse and your children (if you're a legal guardian of another child, then they can be added as well). Your parents would have to be under their own coverage. For senior citizens, they have Medicare available to them if they're not on it already. If they have original Medicare (both Medicare Part A & Medicare Part B), you may want to consider adding a Medicare supplement plan (a.k.a. Medigap plan) to cover the gaps in your original Medicare coverage. Original Medicare only covers about 80% of healthcare expenses - you can have all or a portion of the other 20% covered under a Medigap plan. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
617,What  Is  Wrong  With  Whole  Life  Insurance?,"Assuming this question originates from a negative assertion that (participating) whole life insurance is inherently wrong, there is no wrong on a financial basis as a product. It may very well be unsuitable or not economical depending upon the personal profile of the potential purchaser and their financial goals. The annual premium for guaranteed universal life insurance is generally cheaper than whole life insurance, so the difference in premium could be argued as economical. But participating whole life insurance thats designed for tax advantaged supplemental retirement income can be very valuable to a long term conservative saver who seeks returns that can compete with treasuries as an example."
618,Can  You  Cash  In  Your  Life  Insurance?,"Yes, someone can cash in their life insurance if there is cash value in the policy. If it is early in the years of a cash value policy (Whole Life or Universal Life), surrender charges will be subtracted from the cash value. There are other options for many policies that you may want to explore. E.g. you could possibly make your policy into a reduced paid up policy. You would not have the cash value to spend, but you would still have some life insurance for which you no longer have to pay a premium. Visiting with your agent can be helpful in making the decision whether or not to cash in your life insurance."
619,What  Is  A  Life  Insurance  Certificate?,"A life insurance certificate is a certificate of insurance saying that a policy was purchased, and that outlines the basic provisions of the policy. When you are enrolled in a group policy, you may be given a life insurance certificate. You may need to order a certificate of insurance to prove to a lender or other entity that you have that coverage. For your own individual life insurance, having a copy of the policy is sufficient and preferable."
620,What  Is  Renters  Insurance  Loss  Of  Use?,"Loss of Use for both Renters and Homeowners Insurance pays for any additional expenses incurred if you are forced to leave your home or apartment while repairs are being made. For example, you have to pay additional housing costs because of staying in a motel, you have to eat out more because you have no place to cook your food, you have to store your salvagable furniture in a storage facility. These type of things would be included under Loss of Use."
621,Does  Auto  Insurance  Cover  Hitting  Deer?,"As long as you have physical damage coverage on you vehicle, the damages caused by hitting a deer should be covered (subject to your deductible.) It is normally filed under the Comprehensive (or Other Than Collision) coverage. Although you collided with a deer (or any other wild animal like pigs or hogs) it should NOT becharged against your insurance premiums."
622,Is  Medicare  Likely  To  Run  Out  Of  Money?,The short answer is no. Medicare will not run out of money. Any government program will never run dry as long as DC has the ability to print money. But since 2008 Medicare has paid out more every year than it has in the trust fund. Some projections say the trust fund will run dry by 2024 while others as soon as 2016
623,What  Are  Two  Types  Of  Disability  Insurance?,"The two main types of disability insurance are short term disability, and long term disability insurance. Short term disability insurance pays fairly quickly after a disabling illness or injury occurs, and benefits generally last no longer than two years. Long term disability insurance has a longer waiting period until it pays, usually around 90 days. Then it can last a number of years or all the way to retirement in the event of a disability that continues that long."
624,What  Is  A  Non-Qualified  Retirement  Plan?,"Non-qualified retirement plans are not sanctioned for the tax deduction like qualified plans are under ERISA. Non-qualified retirement plans generally use annuities and life insurance. Annuities can be used in qualified plans, but life insurance cannot. Non-qualified and qualified retirement plans using annuities, for an example, accumulate tax deferred, but the basis of a non-qualified annuity is distributed free of taxation, whereas qualified annuities are fully taxable including basis."
625,What  Is  The  Exclusion  Ratio  Of  Immediate  Annuities?,"The exclusion ration on immediate annuities is referring to the part of the payment that represents the tax free return of basis or the original contributions. The exclusion ration is amortized in the annuitized payments to the annuitants life expectancy. Once the basis is recovered, the payments going forward are entirely gain and taxed as ordinary income."
626,How  Much  Is  A  Premium  For  Health  Insurance?,"A premium is the amount you pay to the insurance company in exchange for coverage under a given policy. When a certain type of claim is made, the insurance company is going to pay the claim instead of you up to the defined amounts as stated inside the policy - for health insurance, the policy may only state the carrier is going to cover a percentage of the claim/fixed dollar amount and you would pay the difference (your coinsurance or copayment amount) Unfortunately there's too many factors that go into premium pricing to say what an average plan costs. Your age is a big factor - the younger you are, the cheaper your premium - the older you are, the higher your premium. Also, if you use tobacco products, your premium can be increased up to 50% as well. If you're an individual buying on or off the exchange (and not securing group coverage through an employer), you need to consider the level plan you want. There are four metal plans: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.Bronze plans generally cover about 60% of your healthcare expenses, Silver is 70%, Gold is 80%, and Platinum is 90%. So, in short, the better the benefits that you want to have, the higher the premium will be.There's also a catastrophic plan, but these are only available to individuals under age 30. If you qualify for a subsidy, the cost of your premium can be lowered as well - whether you qualify for one depends on your income. This is where an independent insurance agent can really help you. They can work with you to look at a wide range of options from many of the top carriers in the industry."
627,Is  Cobra  Health  Insurance  Good?,"In simple terms, a COBRA health insurance is a short-term continuation of the exact same group health plan you had with your employer prior to termination from that job. So, if you liked the coverage provided by the plan prior to termination, you will still like the coverage provided by the plan under COBRA administration because it is the same plan. What you may not like is the cost under COBRA administration. Many people incorrectly assume that COBRA rates are excessively higher than the rates you paid while employed. This is incorrect. By law, your insurance rates under COBRA cannot exceed 102% of the rate you were paying before termination. So, why does the COBRA premium seem so much higher than the premium prior to termination? The answer is your employer's contribution to your health insurance. While you were employed, your employer was definitely paying a portion of yours, the employee's, health insurance premium. If you worked for a ""benefits rich"" employer, they may have been paying all your premium and even contributing some to your dependents' coverage. Under COBRA, the employer no longer is responsible to contribute anything to your health insurance premium. You are therefore responsible for 100% of your portion of the premium as well as that of your dependents. That is why the COBRA cost is more than you were seeing while employed. So, the real question then becomes is it cheaper for me to continue with my current group health plan under COBRA, or is there a better alternative in the personal health insurance marketplace. The only way to answer that question is to solicit quotes from personal health insurers."
628,Is  A  Credit  Check  Required  To  Get  Life  Insurance?,"That is a great question! In the vast majority of cases, life insurance companies will not check your credit rating. In many cases your agreements section of your policy may give them the right to check, and if the value of the policy is high enough they might, but that's pretty much the only times that I know of. Most often, it's your medical history, your prescription history, and occasionally your driving record that they will check. Thanks for asking!"
629,Why  Do  People  Get  Disability  Insurance?,People get disability insurance to protect themselves in the event they become disabled. The loss of income could be financially devastating and having disability insurance will provide a stream of monthly income that will pay bills and provide and replace lost revenue. Many full-time experienced brokers can provide the most expert advice to you.
630,Can  Health  Insurance  Companies  Tell  If  You  Smoke?,Maybe.... Let's say they can't and they just take your word for it- that you are a non smoker. Was it worth the risk when the health or life insurance company finds out that you are a smoker and refuses to pay for anything because you lied? Just be honest.
631,Can  you  get  a  Silvers  Sneakers  membership  at  the  YMCA  if  you  are  on  Medicare?,"From my understanding, you can get the membership issued through private insurance companies - so you would need to have a Medicare supplement (Medigap) plan or a Medicare Advantage plan that offers the silver sneaker membership. I don't believe original Medicare offers silver sneaker membership. So if you're only on Medicare Part A & Part B, you could add a Medigap plan that offers the membership. As to which carriers offer it, I believe it ultimately depends on what state you live in as some carriers offer it in some states and not in others. You can find out if your plan offers the membership on the silver sneakers website health plan locator. Here's a link to their page: WEBSITELINK I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for help with your coverage and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
632,Can  Anyone  Take  Out  A  Life  Insurance  Policy  On  Anyone?,No. There must be insurable interest as defined by economic loss at the demise of the policy insured. If no such financial liability can been established the life insurance company will deny the application. Unrelated parties with no business nor personal economic relationship cannot take out a life insurance policy on someone else.
633,When  Do  I  Need  Commercial  Auto  Insurance?,"This is just to help flesh out the above answer. The two basic thresholds for getting a commercial auto policy. 1. You have a type of legal business entity in place (e.g. Corporation, S-Corp, Partnership, LLC) and you want there to be a company car; OR 2. You are doing business as an individual and you have five or more automobiles associated with the business. While that is easy, it gets more difficult if you do not own the company, but are merely and employee or agent and you are using your personal automobile for business purposes. The business will have to add an endorsement to its Commercial Auto Policy to cover other owned vehicles, so you have coverage. However, the limits associated with liability on your companies Auto Policy might not be high enough to cover you in a serious accident. Here is where you will have to coordinate your personal auto liability coverage with your companies liability in order to make sure you are adequately covered. Hope this helps."

Thousands of people who need Long Term Care Insurance do not purchase it for one reason or another: price, denial, and lack of information all play a part. However, the market is reduced by age (most people do not have an interest in purchasing long term care insurance before age 50), health (at older ages, more people are disqualified due to health problems), income (many retired persons do not have the income to sustain payment of long term care insurance premiums), and assets (without assets to protect, there is less need for LTCI coverage)."

Deductibles Anything special added to the car If it's financed or leased, they'll need to know the name, address, and loan or lease number of the finance or leasing company How you'd like to receive your certificate of insurance Also at this time, it might be a good idea to ask what the premiums will be so you can budget for it. If you haven't sold your old car yet, don't take the coverage off it. This is important. If you let someone test drive your car and they get in an accident or hurt someone, you want to be sure your covered. The premium you'll pay for that short period of time is worth it."

642,Can  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Premiums  Be  Deducted?,"Disclaimer: The following answer is not to be considered tax advice. Contact a qualified tax professional before making any financial decision. Yes, long-term care premium payments may be tax deductible. It depends on the tax status of the individual or business entity filing an IRS tax report. The IRS annually publishes the limits on the amount of premium that can be entered into the tax return and where to enter that amount for consideration of tax deductibility. For non-business consideration, that would currently be ""Medical expenses"" in Schedule A. If by adding the allowable portion of the LTCi premium to Medical expenses causes the total amount of medical expenses to exceed the threshold (formerly 7.5% of AGI, going forward 10% of AGI), then the amount beyond that threshold may be deductible. If not, then the allowable portion of the LTCi premium would not qualify for deduction. For business consideration, the portion of the premium allowable for possible tax deductibility is usually reported on Schedule C. At the present time, only a C-corporation may have 100% of the LTCi premium considered for deductibility. The allowable amounts of LTCi premium for tax deductible consideration are age-based. For insured-ages 40 and under, the published allowable amount of the LTCi premium for 2013 is $360. For those ages 71 and over, the published allowable amount of the LTCi premium for 2013 is $4550. Between that minimum and maximum are various age brackets with different allowable amounts. Those amounts will be adjusted for income-tax-year 2014 and each year thereafter, under current tax law. Tax preparers, accountants, tax attorneys, and tax-preparation software are informed and are updated for each tax year."

651,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Roof  Collapse  Due  To  Snow?,"Great question! The answer is most often yes, if your home has a sloped roof, and your particular policy provides for that coverage. If your roof is flat, that is probably a different story.

If I understand the question correctly the answer is that it depends . You may have coverage as a temporary substitute vehicle to the extent that you have coverage on the vehicle you are substituting for. I would suggest you discuss this issue with your agent, so he can review what exactly you have coverage for. Keep in mind that auto insurance in the US is typically limited to the US and Canada not Mexico so when you travel to another country be sure to go over your itinerary with your agent. Some countries like Mexico do not recognize US insurance as being valid. If you get to the rental counter in another country and forgot to review things with your agent then do this. Buy at least the minimum liability coverage they have required of the locals."

687,How  Much  Coverage  Do  I  Need  For  Renters  Insurance?,"That is a great question! Whole life policies start to accumulate a cash value after the first couple of years the policy is in force. Over time, this cash value can grow to be a fairly substantial amount of money. In the event that you needed some quick cash, you can borrow from this fund, pretty much no questions asked. To do this, you just contact your agent, and ask if your cash value is great enough to cover what you want to borrow. I suggest this, because the amount borrowed can be enough over time with interest to cause your policy to become insolvent, and you are left without insurance. Your agent can help determine how much you can safely borrow (especially if you aren't really planning to repay it). They will write you a check, and you now have tax free cash in your hands to use as it's needed. Bear in mind that your death benefit will be reduced by however much your loan with interest is at the time you pass; and that if the interest on the loan exceeds a certain amount, the company will cancel your policy. But it is still the best way to get quick cash without any credit hassles. I hope that helps, thanks for asking!"

So using an online Contact Us form or emailing the website email address might work best. Keep in mind that many online websites that only give instant quotes for Life Insurance, also offer Disability Insurance quotes from a number of DI carriers (as our website does).

691,Does  Medicare  Cover  STD  Testing?,"Rhinoplasty is generally nose surgery performed for cosmetic purposes and health insurance does not cover cosmetic surgery (unless it is for restorative purposes such as after an accident or cancer). That is not to say that rhinoplasty would never be covered but it would have to be for medically necessary purposes. If you have had chronic health problems caused by your nasal passages it is possible that your insurance carrier will cover this procedure if it is determined to meet the criteria of medical necessity to solve the problem. Sometimes this can result in some real hair splitting with part of the procedure being deemed medically necessary and part of it cosmetic, resulting in only partial coverage for the procedure by the insurance carrier. How the doctor codes the procedure can be an important aspect ofwhether the procedure is approved and how the claim is eventually paid.

(if the other parties had uninsured motorist coverage) It is possible the other parties insurance companies may come back after you personally for the gap or they may just write it off.

695,Does  Life  Insurance  Go  Through  Probate?,"Coverage F Medical Payments is coverage that will pay the necessary medical expenses that are incurred or medically ascertained within three years from the date of an accident causing ""bodily injury"". Coverage applies to accidents that incur on the insured premises (the home) or as the result of an action by the insured at any location. For example, you leave your suitcase in the hallway of a hotel and someone trips over it. The basic limit is $1,000, but higher limits are available and they are very inexpensive. The purpose of this coverage is twofold. First, paying doctor and hospital bills promptly for accidents the insured may have caused could minimize the likelihood of troublesome litigation. Second, submitting the bills helps insurance companies identify accidents early and therefore gives the insurance company time to investigate the circumstances and prepare a defense if necessary. Medical Payments Coverage is not intended to provide accident insurance for the insureds family. Accordingly, the named insured and family are excluded from coverage.

696,Who  Can  Contribute  To  An  Irrevocable  Life  Insurance  Trust?,"Well, there really isn't an on the record answer for this. Older employees tend to cost more to provide health insurance for. Medical plans go one of two ways. One way is a level premium for all employees in the group. This is based on ""averaging"" the premium cost among the group. This is also done for gender. The other way is known as ""banded coverage"" where group premiums are grouped, usually in 5 year blocks and rates vary based on ages. You would hope an employer wouldn't use the medical premium cost as a hiring means test. It would possibly be considered age discrimination."
697,What  Kind  Of  Insurance  Is  Needed  For  A  Home  Daycare?,Great question! One of great things about life insurance (as well as annuity contracts and IRA accounts) is the disposition is generally controlled by the beneficiary designation. Courts are very reluctant to interfere with a valid beneficiary designation. When do we see problems? When the account is not periodically reviewed and the beneficiary designation -- for example a parent is named and they have passed away but no new beneficiary has been named. Of course life insurance proceeds will generally become part of the probated estate when the estate is named as the beneficiary. Easy fix? Be sure to name primary and contingent beneficiaries and review them periodically! Hope that helps...
698,Is  A  Drug  Overdose  Covered  By  Life  Insurance?,"Generally speaking, an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) is set up my those who wish to fund it, i.e. the grantors. Thegrantorsset up the trust, pay premiums into the trust and the trust purchases life insurance for the trustbeneficiaries The grantors are required to have an arms lengthagreementwith the trust and cannot benefit from it directly. Before moving forward setting up an ILIT, consult your estate and probate attorney toestablishyour suitability as grantor."
699,Who  Is  Eligible  For  Disability  Insurance?,If you take care of 6 kids or less some homeowners insurance companies will let you endorse day care coverage on the policy. However this is a very limited coverage. Otherwise you would need to purchase day care insurance which runs on average in my area of Northern California of 1000.00 annual. Generally you would need to work with an independent agent who can find you the right coverage.
700,Who  Needs  Whole  Life  Insurance?,"If the policy was obtained legally (i.e. the applicant did not lie or omit facts about past drug use) and was not a result of suicide during the first two years of the policy, the life insurance policy will most likely pay for death due to drug overdose."
701,Is  Part  D  Medicare  Free?,"To be eligible for Disability Insurance (DI), you must have health that meets the company's underwriting guidelines for that policy. It is harder to qualify medically for Disability Insurance than it is for Life Insurance, because so many more health conditions can cause a Disability than can cause a death. But a good Disability Insurance brokers can guide you to the right policy. You must also have an income in order to be eligible for Disability Insurance. Homemakers or others who do not receive a steady income are, unfortunately, ineligible for coverage. And some occupations will disqualify you. That being said, most people can get Disability Insurance and it is a very important part of a secure financial portfolio. A good Disability Insurance agent will be an immense help to you in determining whether you are eligible for affordable DI coverage."
702,Can  You  Have  Both  Medicare  And  VA  Benefits?,"Anyone who needs life insurance that will last until death at any age needs Whole Life Insurance or Universal Life Insurance with a no lapse guarantee. Without that, the policy might end just before it is needed, and then the possibility of getting a new life insurance policy might not exist. I.e. if you want life insurance to cover final expense, or to pass an estate to someone else, a permanent policy is needed."
703,Do  I  Need  To  Change  Car  Insurance  When  I  Move?,"It is not free, but generally doesn't cost very much. The plans vary by state and each plan covers different prescriptions in different ways. I always recommend, go to WEBSITELINK - choose the ""Drug Coverage (Part D)"" tab, then choose ""find health and drug plans"". This site is run by medicare and you can input what prescriptions you are on and it will show you all of the plans available to you and what your overall out of pocket cost will be, including premium, deductibles, and co-pays for all of the plans available to you. You can even specify a pharmacy you want to work with to make sure they will accept the plan you choose. If you take a couple of generic drugs you plan might cost $15 -$25 per month. If you are very expensive drugs then you might want to spend more in premium to save in overall out of pocket costs."
704,How  To  Choose  The  Right  Retirement  Plan?,"Yes, you can have both Medicare and VA Benefits. One plan will be a secondary payer. Since the Veterans Administration benefits must be used at VA facilities, usually Medicare is secondary to the VA insurance. However, sometimes VA drug benefits are a good supplemental plan to Medicare, and thus becomes the secondary payer."
705,Does  Home  Insurance  Cover  Stolen  Cash?,"If you still reside within the same state, you should not need to change your car insurance. You will need to inform your local agent or carrier of your new address. Your rates may change depending on the carriers rates for the area that you resided in and the area that you moved in to. If you move outside of the state that you currently have your coverage established in then you may have to seek a new carrier."
706,What  Is  Face  Value  Of  Life  Insurance?,"First consideration is whether the plan should be qualified or non-qualified. If your tax bracket is high and/or your employer matches some of your contributions, a qualified plan should be considered. If your tax bracket is low and your employment doesn't offer a match then non-qualified plan should be considered. Once you establish whether the plan should be qualified or non-qualified, then funding your retirement with the proper product is next. To do this you need to establish a personal financial profile that includes a risk tolerance assessment, your financial goals and a life expectancy review."
707,Who  Has  The  Best  Medigap  Plan?,"Yes, up to the policy limit. You will need to check on your policy forms and look at the cash coverage. Its usually up to $1500, but may vary with different insurance companies. Talk with your insurance agent and have him or her explain the circumstances of this coverage if cash was taken from you."
708,Can  A  Minor  Be  A  Beneficiary  On  Life  Insurance?,"The face value of life insurance is the original amount of coverage purchased. In term insurance, this is usually the same as what is paid out at death of the Insured. In permanent insurance, the death benefit may be higher or lower than the original face value, due to loans taken from the policy, or due to earnings within the policy that caused the death benefit to grow."
709,Does  Michigan  Require  Auto  Insurance?,"Medigap plans are standardized (there are 11 options total) meaning the benefits are EXACTLY the same, regardless of which carrier you purchase it through. Several of the major things to look at when shopping for a Medigap plan are the plan benefits (e.g. plan F, plan G, plan N, etc.), the premium, and the premium rating method (community rated, attained-age rated, or issue-age rated). If you want to have coverage that creates a predictable expense structure throughout the year, you will want to look at a plan F or a plan G. If you're willing to take on a larger share of the risk of expenses to keep your premium down, you may want to consider a plan Hi-F, or a plan N. Most companies will use the attained-age rated (rates based on your current age) system such as Omaha, Anthem, CareFirst, Cigna, Humana, and many others. United Healthcare uses the community-rated (rates are not based on age). There are a few carriers that will use the issue-age rated (rates based on age when plan is first purchased) as well such as Everence."
710,How  Do  I  Sign  Up  For  Cobra  Health  Insurance?,"Yes, a minor can be a beneficiary on life insurance. However, until they reach the age when they are legally considered old enough to manage their own money (which is either age 18 or age 20, depending on the state in which you live), someone else will need to be named to manage their money for them. 1) This can be someone you specify in your will. Some people even name two guardians: one to take care of the money (guardian of the estate) and one to take care of the children (guardian of the person). 2) You can create a trust to be the beneficiary of the policy, with the trust spelling out how you want the money to be used on the minor's behalf. 3) If no guardian is specified or trust created, the court may have to appoint a guardian at the time after death when the policy proceeds are collected. You may want to visit with your lawyer and life insurance agent to be sure that you have your policy set up in the way that you want it to, if a tragedy should happen."
711,Can  401(K)  Plans  Provide  Adequate  Retirement  Resources?,"Michigan, like most states, requires its drivers to carry a specified minimum amount of auto insurance coverage. The minimum limits are $20,000 per person, $40,000 per accident and an additional $10,000 for property damage. However, these limits are quite low and if possible, and it is within your budget, you should consider higher limits. As an experienced broker, I highlyrecommend the next level of coverage, that will provide a much broader protection. Free online quotes are always available from the top-rated carriers."
712,Is  A  Military  Pension  A  Qualified  Retirement  Plan?,Your employer will notify you of your COBRA rights within 30 days after your group health insurance plan terminates. You have 60 days in which to exercise your COBRA rights plus an additional 45 days before your premium must be paid. Premiums for your election are retroactive to the first day your of COBRA benefits.
713,What  Does  It  Take  To  Sell  Annuities?,"A 401(k) retirement plan is a defined contribution plan that is funded by various savings and investment products. The adequacy of a 401(k) is based on performance of those products and your contributions. Based on the current trends, the great risk to retirement is human longevity. The odds of most 401(k)s being adequate to fund retirement is somewhat slim."
714,Does  Everyone  65  And  Older  Qualify  For  Medicare?,"The military pension system doesnt meet the standard definitions. It isnt established in the same way a pension plan is established, it isnt funded in the same way either. It most closely resembles deferred compensation. It is taxed like deferred compensation as well."
715,Can  You  Get  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  If  You  Are  Over  80?,"Selling annuities takes a solid understanding of taxation since a key feature of annuities is its tax deferral. Tax deferred annuities also use three basic crediting methods you'll need to learn: fixed interest rate crediting, indexed crediting and separate sub account crediting (or debiting.) If you decide to offer the full array of tax deferred annuities you'll need to secure your life insurance license from your state department of insurance and your series 6 or 7 with a series 63 for your state offered through your broker/dealer via FINRA."
716,How  Much  Does  A  New  York  Life  Insurance  Agent  Make?,Almost everyone age 65 and older qualifies for Medicare. If you are a US citizen or legal resident who has at least 10 years of earned wages in the Social Security system you qualify for Medicare. You must have lived in the US for at least 5 years You may also qualify based on your spouse's time in Social Security
717,Can  A  Sole  Proprietor  Deduct  Disability  Insurance  Premiums?,"Although it was once possible to consider those in their early 80s, and while rate tables may still exist, the insurers have effectively stopped issuing at these ages. To keep premiums low, insurers are marketing to younger ages and doing what they can to increase their business volume at younger ages. This is especially important for them at a time when long term investment yields at insurers have fallen to extreme levels,"
718,Can  an  employer  charge  higher  rates  to  older  employee?,"How much does a New York Life agent make? Well it goes from zero to millions, depending on the agent. New York Life is a commission based company that pays agents for completed transactions in insurance and equity investments. Since the company is based in New York all commission payments are based on the State of New York's restrictions on commissions. So in many cases this means the New York Life agent makes less upfront on sales than other agents. Commission payments tend to be stretched out over time with the policy."
719,Will  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  A  Leaking  Basement?,"Yes a sole proprietor can deduct disability insurance premiums from income for income tax purposes. If you choose to do this, it's important to keep in mind that the benefits paid by the policy if on claim will be received as taxable income and you will need to pay income taxes on the benefits received. If instead you choose not to deduct the premiums, then the benefits can be received income tax free."
720,How  Do  I  Notify  Medicare  Of  A  Death?,"An employer cannot discriminate against an employee based upon their age (among a multitude of other factors). However, that does not necessarily mean that an older employee who compares what they are contributing towards their employer based health insurance with a younger co-worker of the same coverage level will find themselves paying the same amount. This may initially be perceived by the older employee as though they are being discriminated against but this is almost certainly not the case. If your employer's group health insurance rates are age based rates then there is a different rate for each year of age for a covered employee. The community rating requirements of ObamaCare have pushed many health insurance carriers towards this age rated basis though some health insurance carriers still develop a ""composite"" rate for a group after quoting them on an age rated basis (composite rates are one rate for every employee with Employee Only, Employee+Spouse, Employee+Child(ren) or Family coverage regardless of the employee's age). This is how things work under community rating. First of all, there can be no more than a 3 to 1 ratio between the rates for the youngest and oldest employees in the group. To keep things simple let's say the monthly rate for a 25 year old is $200 per month then the monthly rate for a 60 year old would be $600 per month. Then let's say that your employer pays 50% of the employee only rate which leaves the other 50% for the employee to pay. Under this scenario the 25 year old's cost would be $100 per month ($200 x 50%) and the 60 year old's share would be $300 per month ($600 x 50%). Even though the dollar amount paid by each employee differs significantly the employer is treating them the same in that the employer is contributing the same percentage amount towards each employee's coverage. Therefore, there is no discrimination. This is one of the effects of ObamaCare that is increasingly being seen by employees as their old health insurance plans and rate structures are being replaced by ObamaCare compliant plans and the new community rating method."
721,What  Is  The  Difference  Between  Medicare  Advantage  And  Medigap  Insurance?,"Once rain water hits the ground it is considered to be the peril ""flood"". If the water finds its way into the basement that is considered ""seepage"" and is excluded under most homeowners insurance policies. Some companies will consider coverage under the ""water back-up of sewers and drains"" coverage however that is pushing the limits. It will come down to the company and adjuster to decide coverage."
722,How  Much  Does  Health  Insurance  For  A  Newborn  Cost?,"Medicare should be notified of your death as soon as possible. Medicare will request a certified death certificate as part of the process. Assuming you have a Medicare supplement plan, your carrier should also be notified of your death. If Medicare and your Medigap carrier are not notified in time to stop your next payment, you can ask for a refund."
723,Is  An  Auto  Insurance  Settlement  Taxable?,"It can be a bit confusing, but Medigap plans are utilized for persons that are covered under traditional Medicare. You purchase a policy from an insurance company such as Blue Cross, Humana or UnitedHealthcare (although there are plenty of other insurers to choose from). Medicare Advantage is a private health plan that is offered as an alternative to the more-traditional Medicare coverage. Often an HMO or PPO, you may see additional benefits included. An independent broker and/or a reputable website is a great place to view options from multiple companies. You can often instantly compare plans and easily apply online."
724,Will  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Stolen  Cash?,"Notifying the carrier is often critical. If that deadline is missed,it is possible that the next opportunity to add the newborn may be many months away...possibly during an Open Enrollment period. In some states, a ""short-term"" plan can be purchased. Although premiums are very inexpensive, most benefits are subject to a deductible and pre-existing conditions are not covered. This type of policy should only be considered once options provided by the previous question have been exhausted."
725,Why  Do  We  Need  Health  Insurance  Companies?,"Yes and no. Settlement amounts which are to cover vehicle repairs or even replacementand amounts to cover medical expenses resulting from the accident should not be taxable. Ifyou are compensated beyound medical expenses and vehicle repairs or replacement, such as lost wages, etc. These amounts may be taxable. Tax laws change from year to year. Consult your local tax advisor to know what would be taxable under your set of circumstances."
726,How  Much  Car  Insurance  Should  I  Carry  In  Ohio?,"A standard renters policy will offer minimal coverage for stolen cash, if any. You may have zero coverage or as much as $200-$300 depending on the insurance company and policy. It would be surprising if you had more coverage than that without specifically requesting a higher limit via an endorsement to your policy. Read your policy coverage forms under the insured property definitions to see what you have specifically."
727,How  Long  Does  Short  Term  Disability  Insurance  Last?,"That is a great question! I'm sure that you aren't the only one who wonders! The sad truth is though, that between costs of research and development, advertising and marketing, and protection from litigation, most health products are considerably more expensive than they need to be. Services, salaries and overhead contribute to costs also. Could you afford to have a medical emergency without health insurance? Guess what - 60% of all bankruptcies are a result of medical emergencies. There's a great reason. Thanks for asking!"
728,Will  Medicare  Be  There  When  I  Retire?,"Ohio state minimums will go up to $25,000/$50,000 on December 22nd 2013. While this is an improvement, minimum coverage is just that: Minimum. You should work with an agent that can explain these coverages to you and provide you with a guideline for coverage based on your specific financial situation."
729,Can  My  Brother  Drive  My  Car  Without  Insurance?,"Short term disability last for as long as you are continually unable to work due to a covered medical condition, or until the policy benefit period it met, whichever is less. Every policy is different. You make a decision about the length of the benefit period when you purchase the policy. Policies with longer benefit periods cost more than those with shorter benefit periods. You may be able to choose between lengths of 3, 6, 12, or 24 months."
730,Can  I  Get  On  Medicare  Before  The  Age  Of  65?,"The answer is probably ""yes"". Medicare is ""too big to fail"". Working taxpayers paid for Medicare with payroll taxes for years and expect Medicare to be there when they retire. Medicare will survive, but don't expect it to be anything like the current plan. You will pay more in taxes while you are working, higher premiums, deductibles and out of pocket once you are covered by Medicare."
731,Why  Does  Health  Insurance  Exist?,"If your brother does not live with you and heoccasionallydrivers your car, he would be covered inmoststates. However, if your brother moves in with you and lives in your household, in moststates the insurer will require him to be listed on your policy as an additional driver. Of course, if he has his own car that is insured, it will be much easier."
732,What  Are  The  Differences  Between  Medicare  A  And  Medicare  B?,"You cannot get on Medicare before age 65 unless you are on Social Security Disability and have Lou Gehrig's Disease; have been receiving Social Security Disability benefits for 24 months; or you have worked long enough in a federal, state or local government job and meet the requirements of the Social Security Disability program. Some disabled widows and widowers, or divorced disabled persons, may be able to get Medicare under age 65 under some conditions."
733,When  Is  The  Best  Time  To  Buy  Annuities?,"Health insurance came into being to help pay for catastrophic (large) medical claims. Initially health insurance plans only covered inpatient hospital stays. Over time some medical care that could only be handled as an inpatient became available on an outpatient basis. Also, new prescription drugs were developed to treat illness that earlier had been considered incurable. As these new (and quite expensive) drugs came on the market health insurance was expanded to cover outpatient services including Rx, extensive diagnostic testing such as MRI and CT scans and outpatient surgery."
734,What  Does  Life  Insurance  Blood  And  Urine  Test  For?,"Medicare Part A is your hospital coverage. You have a per benefit period (per admission) deductible of $1184 (2013) before Medicare pays their portion. Medicare Part B is your doctor and outpatient coverage. Part B has an annual deductible of $147 (2013) and then Medicare pays 80% of the approved amount, you are responsible for the balance."
735,What  Happens  To  Life  Insurance  During  Divorce?,"The are three basic tax deferred annuity crediting methods: interest rate crediting, indice crediting and separate accounts using equity and bond investments: Once you determine your risk tolerance, and time horizon for distributions, you can prepare to purchase one of these types of annuities for income during retirement."
736,Where  To  Buy  Good  Life  Insurance?,"That is a great question! While they may also look for other things, as a rule they will look for these things:Your sugar levels, for diabetes; cholesterol/triglycerides for heart disease/stroke risk; drug, alcohol and tobacco use (both illegal and legal drugs); chemicals that show kidney health and liver health; proteins that show cancer risk; HIV and hepatitis. All of these things help validate the truthfulness of your answers, and assess their risk insuring you. Great question, thanks for asking it!"
737,How  Much  Does  Basic  Renters  Insurance  Cost?,It will depend on how the divorce is structured. As an Insurance Agent and not an attorney I won't attempt to tell you what the laws says regarding divorce. What I will offer is some suggestions as to what could happen; 1) Nothing - present insurance in force prior to a divorce does not change because of the divorce 2) Judge assigns insurance policy - a judge could order that the beneficiary for the policy be changed to support a divorcing spouse or children. He could also issue instructions as to how the cash value of a policy is to be distributed. I would consult an attorney for a more detailed answer.
738,Is  Northwestern  Mutual  Whole  Life  Insurance  A  Good  Investment?,"You can think of ""good"" in terms of life insurance as a product issued by a solid company at the lowest price possible. The reputation and financial soundness of the company has been discussed above. As to price, you can pay up to 50% less on the same amount and term of insurance from one A-rated insurer to another. What this means is that to get good value on your life insurance, you should comparison shop. Many life insurance websites offer a quoting feature that compares policies available from insurers (from few to dozens of insurers). Obviously, the more choices, the better odds that you will get the lowest price on the insurance you are looking for."
739,Can  You  Get  Cash  From  A  Term  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Basic is a relative term and could many things to many people. In my area, with the carrier that I work with, I have seen a ten thousand dollar base renters policy around eight dollars per month. Please remember every carrier sets its own standards for base coverage and determines it's own pricing model for the coverage it offers. Contact a local agent in your area to determine the coverage offered in your area and the pricing for that coverage."
740,Where  To  Get  Cheap  Renters  Insurance?,"Is Northwestern Mutual whole Life a good investment? Well it depends on your needs. Your needs are what make any choice a good or bad investment. First Northwestern Mutual is a very highly rated fiscally strong company, as many others are. Using Whole life as an investment does work as part of an overall investment strategy as it provides a safe place to accumulate money as well as protecting your other plans. What you will find is whole life insurance is the most boring investment product out there. It's not exciting, it's not racy, it's not an up and down product. It is a slow safe and secure place to put money out there. It's boring because it does what it says it will do. I have owned whole life for almost 30 years and it has never let me down. Can't say the same about my real estate or stock market investments during that same window of time. Oh, last thing to keep it short. Whole life cash values don't go backwards. You can't lose it once it's there."
741,How  Much  Is  Health  Insurance  For  A  60  Year  Old?,"Unfortunately, term life insurance has no cash value to build up. Therefore there is no money to cash out. Think of term life insurance as renting your life insurance and permanent life insurance as buying life insurance. Cash value plans are policies such as whole life and universal life insurance. These are more expensive premiums but do build cash value for times when you need money."
742,How  Much  Of  Your  Portfolio  Should  Be  In  Annuities?,"You can find stripped down Renters Insurance policies for as little as $50.00 per year from any local agent if you have good credit. Most people spend about $150.00 per year on Renters Insurance as they find value in some of the optional endorsements, such as personal property replacement cost (which allows you to buy new items without a deduction for depreciation if you have a claim). Most of my customers add identity theft insurance to their policies so they can file a claim if they are the victim of identity theft. It will help restore incorrect info and pay attorney fees and some time off of work. In short, a basic policy won't cost much, but for a few extra dollars per month you can get much better coverage. What state are you in? I may be able to help you. Send me an email!"
743,Where  Can  I  Get  Insurance  Without  A  Car?,"The average cost in the country for a health insurance plan (overall) is estimated to be about $328 per month - however, this is only reflective upon a silver level plan (not all 2014 state figure averages are available yet).While you can try to come up with an ""average"" cost, there's too many factors that go into premium pricing to say how in relation that compares to an individual as compared to the overall group. In short, an ""average"" premium is a rather useless figure to the individual. It's only representative to a large group - you could have people paying a small nominal amount (after factoring in subsidies) per month to several thousand dollars per month. Even for that there's a ton of information to sift through to get an accurate representation. Under the Affordable Care Act, you have the options for bronze, silver, gold, and platinum level plans (as you go up in metal, the price goes up, but provides better benefits) - some areas also have a catastrophic plan available. In addition, your age and zip codes are big factors as well. The younger you are, the cheaper your premium - the older you are, the higher your premium. Also, if you use tobacco products, your premium can be increased up to 50% as well. I always recommend consulting with an experienced broker regarding your personal health coverage. We can work with you to look at a wide range of options from many of the top carriers in the industry and find the plan that's going to be best suitable for your needs. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
744,Should  Renters  Insurance  Be  Required?,"Tax deferred annuities are ultimately purchased for retirement income, whether in qualified plans or not. A new trend among advisers is to have a foundational income stream that can generate cash flow for the life of the annuitant no matter how long they live. Portfolio percentages differ, but a rule of thumb is 25 to 33%."
745,How  Can  I  Save  Money  On  Homeowners  Insurance?,"There are many folks out there that have a company vehicle or other transportation provided to them. While the exposure is different it is still you driving a car or truck. so, you need coverage too. Don't be confused by the fact the company that owns the vehicle ( typically your employer has liability insurance) . Liability will generally be something you might have in Excess of their coverage. However it is not unusual for you to need coverages such as Medical Payments and Uninsured Motorist. Especially with large employers you might think the employer has a heavy protection for their employees, that may be true for liability but ask your employer about Uninsured or Under insured Motorist Coverage The way to approach securing non owned coverage is the same way we would recommend you obtain any insurance need. Call or visit an agent on line and ask for a quote. If you live in AZ,CA,GA, MO or TX we would be glad to assist you further."
746,What  Is  Life  And  TPD  Insurance?,As and Insurance agent I would have to say yes it should be required. As a consumers pint of view I can see why you would not want the extra expense. But The policies on average are 10 to 15 a month and it lowers your car insurance that much a month with many carriers if you bundle it. What little you are paying for in the event of a loss you would be glad you had the coverage. What a renters policy is paying for is many things from Liability if someone get hurt at your apartment to if you had a fire and had to stay in another place till you could move back in it would cover your living expense. It also covers to replace your thing like clothes and furniture and much more. Many home owners that are renting out the home with some carriers they require that if you are renting the home that they have to have the renters get renters insurance. There are more benefits to having it then not.
747,Can  You  Buy  Life  Insurance  On  Other  People?,"The most expensive mistake a homeowner can make is to be underinsured. Regardless of what the premiums were, a single high value loss that exceeds the limits of the policy can make those saving immaterial. Setting adequate limits is absolutely crucial. The person that can help set appropriate limits is a reliable insurance agent. This is a far greater problem than many think. The primary place where this shows up is having inadequate liability limits. Your homeowners policy provides liability coverage for personal injury and property damage law suits. The company pays all costs for a lawsuit up to the limits of the policy. After that the homeowner is facing the lawsuit alone. Most companies do not offer adequate liability limits and most policyholders select limits that are lower than the maximum offered by the company. An umbrella policy is necessary for most homeowners. The second area that is often underinsured is valuable collections. The homeowners policy has internal limits for recovery on certain items. Most homeowner dont know that their inherited sterling silver is woefully underinsured. They dont understand that those guns in the cabinet could be destroyed and they would only get a fraction of their value. The same is true of jewelry, a coin collection, and many other items. This is all detailed inside the policy, but few homeowners ever read their policy. Some people continue to underinsure their structure. While not as common it is an increasing phenomenon. A homeowner will improve the home and never inform the company or agent. In the event of a loss the amount of coverage might not return the home to its updated glory. This coverage is really inexpensive, however a loss can be paralyzing. Some homeowners have multiple homes. The second homes are often in hazardous areas, such as lakefront, beach front and mountain property. The cost of replacing one of these homes can exceed the insured value because of inflated reconstruction costs. If a forest fire sweeps through some summer cottages, there will be a great demand for contractors to do the work and there will also be bidding for materials. It can get ugly. So adequate insurance is the first step, the second step is to focus on the policy itself. Homeowners can often save significant money by increasing the deductibles on their policies. The deductible should be set at the amount of loss that could be absorbed without serious disruption to the family finances. That is often more than the deductible in the policy. Companies traditionally offer discounts if coverages are packaged. Some companies cover a wide range of policies and by bringing those to a single carrier premium savings can often be realized. This is particularly true if you own another residence that you lease to someone else. Often extending liability coverage from you homeowners policy will save you money. Companies often give discounts for loss prevention. The most common is the central station monitored alarm systems. While companies are rarely as generous as the alarm sales people indicate, there are savings to be had by simply providing a certificate of installation. Sometimes the homeowners policy will be modified if substantial rehabilitation is done to the home. You would need to talk to your agent about this. You could also discuss the jewelry insurance if the jewelry is most often located in a safe deposit at the bank."
748,What  Is  The  College  Major  To  Study  In  Order  To  Be  An  Insurance  Agent?,"Life and TPD Insurance stands for Life and Total and Permanent Disability Insurance. It is a Life insurance policy that has an add on that would pay a lump sum if the insured person were to become totally and permanently disabled. If this was paid out, the death benefit is usually reduced by the TPD amount paid out."
749,Does  Medicare  Cover  DME  Supplies?,"You can buy life insurance on other people if there is an insurable interest and the other person is willing to sign the application as the insured. An insurable interest means that the policy owner or beneficiary must stand to suffer a direct financial loss if the insured passes. Examples of this are spouses, business partners and children/parents."
750,Can  You  Borrow  Against  Your  Retirement  Plan  In  Pennsylvania?,"There are only a handful of universities that offer degrees in Insurance. If you are looking for professional training law would probably be the most helpful, particularly if you want to be involved in estate planning or commercial insurance. A degree in marketing would prepare you for that aspect of the insurance business. Actually, insurance agents come from a wide variety of educational backgrounds."
751,What  The  Cost  Of  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"Yes, Medicare covers DME supplies if they are prescribed by your doctor and are for use in your home rather than in a health care facility, long term rehab center, etc. In addition, Durable Medicare Equipment must be long lasting, used for a medical reason, and not useful to someone who is not sick or injured."
752,How  Much  Homeowners  Insurance  Do  I  Need  In  Connecticut?,"This is a pretty difficult question to answer in a forum like this. I highly recommend that you speak to a professionalone-on-one to completely evaluate your needs and to see if you can borrow - and if so, if it would be financially smart to borrow from a retirement fund. Feel free to contact me if you have no one else. To give you a little idea if you could however, here are some guidelines: Most retirement funds are NOT AVAILABLE to borrow from. If you have a Defined Benefit or a Cash Balance Benefit, you can not borrow from it. You can move your funds to a different account, with professional guidance to avoid penalties. But with these types of accounts, you usually can not touch until you retire. If you have a Profit Sharing account or a 401K - you MAY be able to borrow depending upon the rules of the company that it is through and/or the rules of the company you work for. Again, however, most will not allow you to borrow. If they do, typically you can only borrow 50% of YOUR contributions (not what your company contributes) or $10k, whichever is less. Again, this is a very difficult and technical topic to get a solid answer here. Look me up if I can be of any further help."
753,Does  Medicare  Have  Estate  Recovery?,"The cost of long-term care insurance is based on many factors including your age,health conditions, average cost of facilities in your area and the type of coverage you want. An experienced broker is ideal to review the best plans with you at the best prices. But don't work with anyone unlicensed or a part-time worker. Any person that spends any significant amount of time in the media side of the business will not be your best resource. Once again, a full-time broker is going to provide the best information."
754,What  Company  Has  The  Cheapest  Renters  Insurance  In  Pennsylvania?,"Talk to your insurance professional and ask about insuring to value. This means insuring to the calculated cost to reconstruct your home in the event of a loss. Your agent will be able to offer a comprehensive reconstruction analysis and based upon that, make a proper recomendation for the amount of coverage. Once that is established be sure that a reconstruction cost guarantee is included in your policy."
755,Why  Would  Someone  Be  Denied  Life  Insurance?,"No, the Estate Recovery Act pertains only to Medicaid recipients who were over age 55 and received benefits for a certain period of time, or received certain services paid for by Medicaid (nursing home, prescription drugs, and others). Beginning in Jan, 2010, estate recovery is not allowed for Medicare Savings Expenses paid by the state."
756,Does  FAFSA  Count  Annuities?,Have you seen that esurance TV commercial ( WEBSITELINK ) ? Everybody wants CHEAP insurance and almost any insurance can give you CHEAP insurance .... But the reality is that you get what you pay for. Renters insurance is probably the most affordable coverage that you can find and will probably cost you $15/ month for great coverage. Make sure your policy has replacement cost on contents and includes additional living expenses. Saving $5/ month could wind up costing you thousands of dollars if you have the wrong policy. Check with an independent insurance agent who can look at multiple carriers and see what policy is right for you.
757,How  To  Buy  My  Own  Health  Insurance?,"There are numerous reasons to be declined for life insurance. Think of it in terms of gambling. You are placing a small bet, monthly premium, in order to make sure your loved ones have enough money to live at their current means, which is a large payoff at your death. Therefore an underwriter will look at all of the factors to determine your risk of dying within a specified period of time. They look at age, build, medical history, health, lifestyle, residence, occupation, etc. to determine that risk. If they feel any of these factors are too risky you will be declined for life insurance."
758,Can  I  Deduct  Auto  Insurance  Premiums?,"No the FAFSA does not generally count annuities in its calculation for Expected Family Contributions. Though the FAFSA does not include annuities, some colleges and universities use proprietary methods for calculating family contributions which may include annuities and their cash values. These methods generally involve additional forms that ask certain questions not asked by the FAFSA."
759,Who  Is  A  Key  Employee  In  401K?,It is easy to buy your own health insurance. Many top-rated insurers offer affordable plans that will provide comprehensive coverage. Finding those plans is easiest when you utilize an experienced broker and/or their website. You can quickly compare rates and benefits from the best insurers in your area and apply online. There is no cost and you'll have free unbiased advice from a seasoned veteran available at any time.
760,Can  You  Withdraw  From  A  Roth  401K  Without  Penalty?,"That is more of a question for your accountant actually. Under normal circumstances, no. However, if you own a business and use your car at least in part for that business, then your accountant may tell you that at least a portion of the premiums that you pay may be deductible as a business expense."
761,Why  Is  Import  Car  Insurance  More  Expensive?,"An employer can establish a defined contribution retirement plan in accordance with Internal Revenue Code 401(k.) The employer is responsible for the plan documents including definitions. While not required there may be some mention of key employees. If your plan has provisions like this, they would be in the plan document which is available from your employer."
762,Can  You  Get  Life  Insurance  If  You  Are  Ill?,"One of the benefits of the Roth IRA is that once you have reached retirement age, the withdrawals are not taxed. The entire purpose of the Roth IRA is to use after tax dollars to fund it. This means the income was already taxed when you earned it and you put after-tax dollars into the account. That being said, if you are not at retirement age, there are some potential concerns. If you are under 59 1/2 years of age there is an early withdrawal penalty of 10% on a federal level. Beyond that your withdrawal may be taxed as regular income. You would be best served by speaking with your accountant to see how a withdrawal may impact your unique financial situation."
763,Will  Life  Insurance  Know  If  I  Smoke?,"That is a great question! The answer is simple, the cost of your auto insurance for your imported car is higher because the cost to repair it, should you damage it, is more expensive than a domestically made car would cost. The expense for parts and the specialized mechanics would cost the insurance company more, so they pass that expense on to you. Thanks for asking!"
764,Who  Is  Uninsurable  For  Life  Insurance?,"Can you get life insurance if you are ill? That is a very good question. We tend to think of those who have serious diseases as most unlikely to get life insurance. But in reality, those who are undergoing testing for an (as yet) undiagnosed illness, those who are in the beginning stages of treatment for a newly diagnosed illness, or those who are awaiting surgery or treatment, are likely to be postponed until their illness is diagnosed or showing stable control. Once the health condition has been under control for a while, they will have a much easier time finding a life insurance policy that will cover them. The length of time that stability must be shown depends on the illness. For blood pressure or diabetes, 3 to 6 months of control is sufficient with some companies. For MS, most companies like to see at least a year of stability, although coverage can be obtained shortly after diagnosis. Cancer is usually postponed until a year of remission or more. Many people first consider applying for life insurance when they become ill. Contact a good impaired risk agency with lots of choices to find something you can get now and/or for the future."
765,Is  Now  A  Good  Time  To  Buy  Annuities?,"Will life insurance know if I smoke? Well, depending on how much coverage you purchase, if anyone else knows you smoke chances are they will too. First off, most insurance companies ask for an attending physicians statement and chart notes. So if you've told your doctor, you smoke. Second, many plans require labs so if you smoke it will show up in your labs. And finally, some states have enacted laws that skip the two year contestability clause on life insurance when the applicant lies about smoking. These states view this as no contract was formed and won't let the carrier pay a reduced benefit. Just a return of premium."
766,What  Is  The  Dwelling  Amount  On  Home  Insurance?,There are plans available for anyone. Usually if a person is in very bad health there will be a graded death benefit for the first two or three years. The healthier you are the better your rates. If a person is very healthy that person can get preferred rating. If a person has Aids or some other serious disease they would have to go guaranteed issue and pay higher rates.
767,What  Renters  Insurance  Should  I  Get?,"Tax deferred annuities can be product solution for long term savers, investors or those in high tax brackets. Guaranteed fixed interest rate annuities that are 7 or 10 years may be too long a position with the recent uptick in Treasuries, so most fixed interest rate annuities with five year or less may be a consideration. If you believe the market has topped out and a correction is at hand then indexed and variable annuities could be risky products. But if your market expectations are positive both of those types of annuities could be a consideration."
768,Is  Life  Insurance  A  Legal  Requirement  For  A  Mortgage?,This is the amount your home itself is covered for. Generally you must be insured for at least 80% of the replacement cost of your home. This is determined by calculations that insurance companies use based upon construction costs in your area. Most companies require you to be insured for 100% of replacement cost. This allows the company to completely rebuild your home in the event of a total loss.
769,What  Does  The  Letter  T  Mean  In  A  Medicare  Number?,"I assume you are doing business with a trusted insurance agent, if not, find one. Selecting limits is the chief concern. You want enough coverage so that a lawsuit for bodily injury or property damage will not bankrupt you. Then, you want enough personal property coverage to replace the essential things that you own, furniture, clothes, appliances etc. While the premium is important, having the right coverage is critical."
770,Is  Life  Insurance  Sales  A  Good  Career?,"No it is not a legal requirement. Many lenders however will require mortgage life insurance to protect themselves. Also, there have been cases where a judge has required a divorced spouse to carry life insurance to cover a mortgage or protect minor children although these cases would depend on the situation. As a general rule however, you are not legally required to carry mortgage insurance."
771,Does  Where  You  Live  Affect  Your  Car  Insurance  Rates?,"Anyone who has Medicare will have noticed their Medicare number is generally their social security number with a letter added on to the end. If you see the letter ""T"" in your Medicare number, this means you have both Medicare Parts A & B, but are not yet receiving social security benefits."
772,Can  Both  Husband  And  Wife  Have  Roth  IRA?,"Perhaps this question is best answered by the statistical averages gathered over the years by LIMRA (Life Insurance and Market Research Association):- Only about 7% of agents that sign on with a single insurance company remain with that company past the first five years.- The percentage that remains in the business after departing from their first insurance carrier is around 20% and each year that percentage declines.- About 3% of all individual sales representatives that enter the insurance business remain in the business for 20 years or more.- The average age of a life insurance agent today is about 57 years old.It has been said that if you can sell life insurance, you can sell anything. As a career, being a life insurance agent can be very rewarding, but it is highly unlikely that life insurance will be the only line of insurance you sell unless you become highly specialized and work with other advising financial professionals as a team in the high-net worth market. Otherwise, you will find it necessary to sell other lines of insurance, notably health, DI, Annuities, LTCi, or property-casualty insurance (auto, home, liability, etc.) to pay the bills.Sometimes, insurance agents become securities-licensed and obtain various professional designations that allow them to practice financial advisory services and sales of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. This is a fairly recent trend and usually results in the sale of life insurance being a rare occurrence due to all of the other responsibilities of being a financial advisor.Perhaps the most rewarding thing about being a life insurance agent (or being licensed to sell life insruance, among other things) is being the person that ""delivers the check"" to the survivors of someone that died prematurely and on whom there was a high level of financial dependence."
773,Is  Health  Insurance  Free  In  Canada?,"Where you live can and does effect your auto insurance rates. Insurance companies base rates on experience in any given area. These would include but not limited to characteristics of drivers, types of vehicles and claims based on frequency and severity. Actuaries then determine rates according to any given area or areas. There are many misconceptions by consumers as to which area has a better rate vs. another. For example some may believe a city would have a higher rate vs. a rural area. However the fact may be that while a city has more frequency of accidents a rural area may have much more severe accidents due to road conditions and so on. While this is only an example this should give you an idea of how rating works."
774,Does  My  Spouse  Have  To  Be  On  My  Auto  Insurance?,"That is a great question! And the great answer is yes, you both can have your own Roth, and contribute to each. There are limits, so if your individual incomes are in the low $100k area, you can cap out, and if together your combined income puts you at $180k or above, you can max out also. As long as you fall in between that range, go for it! Good luck, and thanks for asking!"
775,Who  Should  I  Set  Up  A  Roth  IRA  With?,"It depends on which Province you live in. In Ontario, you don't pay a premium for basic healthcare but in British Columbia you do. We moved away from Canada because the taxes were so high so ""free healthcare"" is up for debate. Also, Doctors can be hard to find in some areas."
776,Does  Geico  Offer  Term  Life  Insurance?,"You'll also want to consider having her on your policy as the MARRIED rate is normally LOWER than the SINGLE rate. Showing your spouse will ""prove"" you are married. You might not want to let him/her drive your vehicle but that is between you and him/her. Also, if the spouse has their own vehicle, the ""multi-car"" discount will also save you money."
777,What  Is  Meant  By  Life  Insurance  Creates  An  Immediate  Estate?,"I would like to say a Retirement Income Certified Professional (RICP) however, that would be self-serving. You should carefully choose a person whose advice you can trust. While the procedure to start a plan is routine, at some point you will need to make changes and ultimately derive income. This requires experience."
778,What  Qualifies  As  Self  Employed  Health  Insurance?,"Geico offers Term Life Insurance through non-affiliated insurance companies. In other words, the life insurance is not underwritten by Geico; Geico just helps you get it by referring you to a brokerage that carries quotes from multiple life insurance companies. The agency they refer you to is not owned by Geico."
779,How  Much  Will  I  Be  Fined  For  Not  Having  Health  Insurance?,"The economic leverage of life insurance and its tax advantages can create an instant estate within the justification and insurable interest rules. A healthy male age 65 may be able to receive a 4 to 1 benefit to dollar spent on a single deposit. A healthy female age 65 may be able to receive a 5 to 1 benefit to dollar spent on a single deposit. A survivorship policy with a healthy male and female age 65 may be able to receive a 6 to 1 benefit to dollar spent on a single deposit. So if you want to make a difference in the lives of your children, grandchildren, great grandchildren or charity, this is the economic way to go."
780,What  Is  Good  Home  Insurance?,Most people who are self employed need to pick up an individual policy. This would be considered a self employed health insurance policy. There is no set difference or requirements between a person who is employed and has to pick up his own insurance or a self employed person. There could be a difference as far as tax being deductible since a self employed person will usually file a Schedule C. An HSA qualified plan is a great way to purchase health insurance if you are self employed due to the tax advantages. Ask your tax adviser.
781,What  Should  Term  Life  Insurance  Cost?,"Under the new affordable care act, everyone will have to have health insurance or pay a penalty (also known as an ""individual shared responsibility payment""). If you choose to pay the penalty instead of securing coverage, you will still be responsible for 100% of your medical care. The penalty is calculated in one of two ways (you pay whichever is the higher amount). In 2014, the penalties will be calculated as: 1) 1% of your yearly household income featuring a maximum penalty as the national average yearly premium for a bronze plan. 2) $95 per person for the year (If under age 18, then $47.50) featuring a maximum penalty per family of $285 under this method. The penalty calculations will change each year. In 2015, method one increases to 2% of your yearly household income and method two increases to $325 per person. In 2016, it will increase again to 2.5% for method one and $695 per person for method two. The penalty methods will be adjusted for inflation in later years."
782,Can  I  Enroll  In  Medicare  Part  D  Anytime?,"--> Normal 0 What makes up a good homeowners insurance policy? In my mind its a policy that is going to do what you want it to do, at a price you are willing to pay. The problem is, most insurance buyers dont really know what they want the policy to do. Most people seem to want a policy to repair or replace their home if its damaged . To me that means you want an all-risk policy on your home with a Guaranteed Replacement Cost feature, which automatically increases your amount of insurance following a loss, to whatever it takes to rebuild your home if it is damaged and has to be rebuilt. All- Risk type policies will not cover everything but they will specifically state what you are not covered for and you can decide where to go from there. Few policies include the Guaranteed Replacement feature; so make sure you ask for it. And if the company doesnt offer it, you may want to check with someone else. Most people also want their personal stuff replaced should it be damaged or destroyed. So a good homeowners policy should do that. That means, all-risk replacement cost coverage for all your stuff. If its not all-risk(often called Special Coverage or Open Perils) Replacement Cost, you may want to look further. Again, not all types of damage will be covered but the policy will tell you what you are not covered for so you wont have any surprises. Often specific exclusions can be eliminated for an additional cost. Most policies dont include these features so make sure you ask for them if that is the kind of coverage you expect. Good homeowners policies will include coverage for the additional expenses you may incur should your home be damaged and you have to live somewhere else while it is being repaired and a nominal amount of Personal Liability coverage, a good one will have limits not less than $300,000. A good homeowners policy will be offered by a financially strong, at least A-rated insurance company hopefully with a local contact to help you understand what you are getting, makes sure it covers any special situations that make up your life and is there should you have a significant claim. A good homeowners policy is one that doesnt get cancelled the first time you have a claim. Buying insurance on-line may be popular and convenient but you have to know what you are doing. Remember if there is a problem, you are one small policy and they are one big insurance company. It may be a good time to have somebody local on your side."
783,Who  Should  Be  The  Beneficiary  Of  My  Life  Insurance?,"Unfortunately, it is impossible to give a guideline on what Term Life Insurance should cost, because the cost varies so much from person to person. If you buy it when young and very healthy, and lock in the rate for a very short time, you can get it for under $10/month for $100,000 of coverage. If you buy it when older or while having serious health problems, and lock in the premium for the rest of your life, the premium could be over $300/mo for that amount. To find the best price for you, go to a website that offers instant quotes and input your information. Keep in mind that these quotes will need to be followed up by a phone call to verify accuracy, or at least by clarifying your health information on the application."
784,What  Is  Medicare  Region  C?,"As a rule no, you can enroll in Part D when you first become eligible, during the Anual Election Period, or if you have a Special qualifying event such as losing your group coverage or the plan pulls out of the area, or you move out of the service area. If you qualify for Extra Help with your drugs from Medicare or if you are also on Medicaid you can swithch whenever you want."
785,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Theft  Of  A  Bike?,"The rule of thumb when choosing a beneficiary is the person who has the most to lose by your death. A loved one usually a family member is chosen as a primary beneficiary and maybe a child will be chosen as the contingent beneficiary. However in cases where no one would be hurt financially upon your death, the next person to consider would be the person who will handle your funeral arrangements and estate. This way they have the cash to pay final expense and other final bills."
786,What  Is  Select  Term  Life  Insurance?,"Medicare Region C includes the states Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. This and other regions are designated for the purpose of supplying Durable Medical Equipment (DME) for Medicare."
787,Does  Everyone  Have  Health  Insurance  Now?,Renters insurance covers your personal property and bike is consider personal property. For examble you have a nice high end bike that cost $1500 it get stolen at the store you must call your insurance compay and file a claim they will deduct your dedutable from the pay out. Good Luck
788,Can  I  Be  On  My  Boyfriends  Health  Insurance?,"The term ""select"" when dealing with any type of life insurance is meaningless. There are internet sites that have that word in their name, perhaps because they have already determined which companies to offer coverage from. This is just advertising but with no real value for the consumer, on the internet or off."
789,Does  Full  Coverage  Health  Insurance  Cover?,Currently 85 - 90% of the population is covered by health insurance. About a third of the population has Medicare or Medicaid as their primary coverage. The rest are covered by an employer plan or individually owned health insurance. Starting in 2014 most everyone will be required to purchase health insurance if they are covered by a government or employer plan.
790,How  Do  I  Get  Obamacare?,No. A boyfriend or girlfriend does not meet the legal criteria for being considered an eligible dependent (you can imagine how complicated that could getin some people's lives). Legally married spouses are still generally considered eligible dependents though that coverage option is evolving rapidly due to a quirk in the health care reform law that does not define spouses as dependents. Natural born and step-children and individuals for which a person has a court order appointing them as legal guardian also qualify as dependents. I'm afraid you'll have to get married if you want to get covered under your boyfriend's health insurance.
791,Do  You  Need  A  License  To  Sell  Life  Insurance  In  Illinois?,"I will assume you are talking about a health insurance plan that offers first dollar coverage, meaning you pay a premium and the insurance company pays for everything else. In today's market place, there is no such animal. All plans have some type of cost sharing built into them. It can be in the way of deductibles, copays, or co-insurance. The question could also be referring to what most call major medical insurance. These policies pay your doctor and hospital for treatment you received (after you pay the copay or deductible). There are some plans call indemnity (sometimes called supplemental) plans. AFLAC is a well known seller of indemnity plans. While they have their place in the market place, they should not be confused with major medical insurance. Major medical insurance will protect you against a large medical bill (say $100,000+); while indemnity plans are designed to pay you a fixed about of money based on the limits of the policy. You want to have a major medical plan in place first, then possibly add an indemnity plan second."
792,Why  Is  Long-Term  Disability  Insurance  Important?,"You're generally getting your health insurance coverage from one of two places, the individual market or your spouse's group coverage. If you qualify for a subsidy, you would want to look at health insurance ON the exchanges - subsidies can only be used for on-exchange policies. The first open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act ended on March 31, 2014. If you're looking for an individual policy, you will need a special enrollment period (a qualifying ""life-changing event"") to purchase a plan outside the open enrollment period, otherwise you may be subject to paying a penalty. The penalty in 2014 is the greater of: 1) 1% of your yearly household income featuring a maximum penalty as the national average yearly premium for a bronze plan. 2) $95 per person for the year (If under age 18, then $47.50) featuring a maximum penalty per family of $285 under this method. The penalty figures will change in future years. Consulting with an experienced broker is always a great first step to learn more about plans available in your area and discuss and compare quotes. Please feel free to contact me for further assistance. Thanks very much."
793,Does  An  Inground  Pool  Increase  Homeowners  Insurance?,"That is a great question! Every state requires an agent that wishes to do business in their State to be licensed, so the answer is yes. You can be licensed in several States, but you have to do them individually, and pay the requisite fees for each. Some may require testing, others won't. I hope that helps, thanks for asking!"
794,How  Can  We  Find  Out  What  Insurance  Company  Insurances  My  Neighbor's  House?,"Long Term Disability Insurance is important because most people do not have enough savings to cover being off of work for over 3 months or more. The benefits of Long Term Disability Insurance can pay until retirement, if you get that type of plan. If someone were to become permanently disabled in their younger to middle age years, that is a lot of years of income coming in. Without that income, many years of living on only Social Security Disability can cause financial devastation to even the wealthiest of families."
795,Can  You  1035  From  Life  Insurance  To  Annuity?,"I have an in ground pool in my own back yard and we absolutely love it. It's great being the house that all my kids' friends want to go to. But, does it increase my insurance premiums? Not necessarily, although it probably should. I'll explain why in just a moment. First, let's look at what an insurance company wants if you do have a pool. The biggest thing they want is a fenced enclosure around the entire pool. They want to be sure that anyone who enters the pool intended to enter the pool. Also to keep animals and small children from wandering into the pool. It's usually not a case of a premium increase, it's a yes or no question. If you do what they want(fence), they'll usually insure you with no increases. If you don't do what they want, they'll just refuse to insure you. Now, why would your premium increase? Because a pool brings more liability along with it. Bad things can happen even if you take precautions. I would recommend liability limits of at least $500,000 and, usually at least a $1,000,000 umbrella policy. Doing this may cost you a little more but it's well worth it. It may be as little as $85/year or it may be a little more depending on your home, cars, and family. Be smart, spend small dollars now to avoid big dollars later."
796,Where  Should  I  Buy  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  In  Michigan?,"To the best of my knowledge there is not any public availablility of insurance coverages or carriers that a person or company may use for their coverage. About the only way to get that information would be to contact your neighbors and ask them for it. Laws vary from state to state, but many of the laws currently in place prevent insurance agents and carriers from providing any coverage or personal information to anyone but authorized parties."
797,Will  Medicare  Premiums  Go  Up  In  2014?,"Yes, you can do a 1035 exchange on the cash value of a permanent life insurance to an annuity. Some people choose to do this because of the higher gains of an annuity, or because they no longer need life insurance. But sometimes it is better to 1035 your life insurance to another life insurance policy. There is no going back, so be sure to review all the consequences with a trusted financial advisor before making this decision."
798,Can  I  Have  Auto  Insurance  In  Another  state?,"There are local career agencies and brokerage shops in Michigan that offer long term care insurance. But you may also want to use online brokerage firms that offer an inventory of companies, sometimes with side by side comparison spreadsheets to understand which company is most competitive. Genworth is one of the leading long term care insurance companies in the market place."
799,How  Much  Should  You  Spend  On  Life  Insurance?,It is unknown whether Medicare premiums will go up in 2014. Medicare rates changes for the following year are announced about the middle of October or November of the year before. To see what the premiums will be in 2013 check the Medicare.com website about midway through the fall of 2013.
800,Does  Medicare  Part  D  Cover  Cymbalta?,"That is a great question! The answer is you really don't want to. First, most States will require that the car be licensed and registered in the same State, and levy fines or license suspensions if they find it isn't. The insurance company will more often than not deny a claim, or even cancel your policy if they find that you misrepresented where the car was being used. All in all, it's not a good idea. Thanks for asking, though!"
801,How  Do  I  Get  Short  Term  Disability  Insurance?,"Some financial counselors recommend spending a certain percent of your income on life insurance. However, there are so many different uses for life insurance, and the price varies so much based on age and health and the type of policy purchased, that it doesn't always work to use a rule of thumb. If you are a retired person with a high income and net worth, you may want to purchase life insurance to avoid and/or pay estate taxes, and to transfer your wealth to your heirs. The cost of this type of policy could be pricey, but it would save you a lot of money. In contrast, you may be a young newlywed who can only afford to spend only $20 per month on life insurance. This could possibly buy $250,000 of term insurance for you and your spouse. At that time in your life, that expenditure would be appropriate."
802,How  Much  Do  Life  Insurance  Agents  Make  In  Illinois?,"Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are sold by private health insurance companies. Each plan is going to have a formulary (the list of drugs a plan will cover). Not every formulary is going to cover every drug. You can look up which plans cover your prescriptions on Medicare.gov using the ""find health & drug plans"" tool."
803,Does  Medicare  Cover  Hepatitis  C  Screening?,"Most people get Short Term Disability Insurance through their employer in the form of a group plan. Sometimes the employer pays the premiums, sometimes the employee pays the premiums, and sometimes they share the costs. If your place of business does not offer Short Term Disability Insurance, you can purchase it through an independent agent in an individual plan. I would be happy to assist you, if you'd like."
804,Who  Regulates  Variable  Annuities?,"Life insurance agents' wages vary widely in Illinois, as they do across the nation. If the agent has a lot of high wealth clients and can sell a large range of products, they can make hundreds of thousands of dollars. On the other hand, many agents in Illinois and other states are unable to make a living in that career. How much you make depends on hard you work, who you know, and getting some breaks."
805,Who  Offers  Purchased  Life  Annuities?,"Original Medicare does not cover routine Hepatitis C screening, but it can cover screening if approved by Medicare due to signs or symptoms of Hepatitis C being present. In that case, the screening becomes diagnostic and can be covered by Medicare guidelines. Under Medicare Advantage PPO plans, routine Hepatitis C screening IS covered."
806,Why  Do  I  Need  Critical  Illness  Insurance?,"An insurance product is regulated by the department of insurance.

A registered representative must be licensed with both governing bodies."
807,Does  AARP  Have  Auto  Insurance?,Many different Insurance Companies offer Lifetime Annuities. The best thing to do is to use an independent agent to shop the current rates to find the best current rate for you. It is important to use a company with strong financial ratings. For a Lifetime Annuity I recommend at minimum an A rating.
808,Does  Getting  Auto  Insurance  Quotes  Affect  Your  Credit  Score?,"I recommend all my clients need a critical illness policy to protect themselves from the costs involved with the illness. What most fail to think about is what happens after the illness. A critical illness often leaves people unable to work or sometimes lose their job (and possibly the health insurance that went with it). A cash critical illness plan of any benefit amount helps maintain the lifestyle you had prior to your illness by affording cash to pay the mortgage, cars, food, necessities and other unforeseen out of pocket costs associated with the illness. At the very least I advise clients to purchase a critical illness plan that matches their max out-of-pocket of their health plan so in the worst case scenario they will have no risk exposure."
809,Does  Medicare  Cover  In  Home  Care  For  The  Elderly?,"AARP auto insurance is a program written through The Hartford. Only the Hartford can offer the AARP discount to both home and auto insurance.

810,What  Are  The  Two  Basic  Types  Of  Life  Insurance  Policies?,It is typically called a soft hit on your credit score and it should not effect your score.

811,Which  Type  Of  Life  Insurance  Pays  A  Dividend?,"Original Medicare (Parts A & B) cover some part-time home health services such as physical therapy, skilled nursing care, speech-language pathology servcies, etc. Medicare does not pay for 24 hour home health care however, nor meals delivered to your home, personal care, and homemaker services. Please note, there are a number of conditions that must be met for Medicare to cover your home health care. If you need more than part-time/intermittent home care, Medicare will not cover the expenses. Home health care is very expensive and you can deplete your savings paying for it. For someone wanting 24-hour home health care to be covered by their insurance, they should look into securing a long-term care insurance policy. While long-term care can be an expensive type of insurance to have, you're paying pennies on the dollar if you needed to make a claim on the coverage. There's many moving parts to long-term care insurance. If you're looking to secure this type of coverage, it's most helpful to consult with an experienced broker to help build a policy that will best serve your needs. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Thanks very much."
812,Does  Farm  Bureau  Offer  Renters  Insurance?,"The two basic types of life insurance policies are Term and Permanent.

Permanent Life insurance comes in Whole or Universal Life. Permanent Insurance can be purchased to provide coverage for your whole life. There are many different features to Permanent coverage so it is important to discuss this type of insurance with a reputable agent before making your choice."

If you are in Wisconsin give me a call and I can try to help you with coverage if you are not in Wisconsin, then I would suggest contacting your local Farm Bureau office to ask them for a local agent."
815,How  Much  Will  You  Be  Fined  For  Not  Having  Health  Insurance?,"Boy there are any number of reasons that I can offer to illustrate why our car insurance, or any insurance for that matter, may go up, or down for that matter. Major factors in pricing usually include one's age, drivng experience, driving history, claims history, etc. You may pay more for car insurance in certain areas of the country than others based upon population, company experience within those territories etc. Naturally another major factor is the year, make model and type of car that you drive and insure. Finally, over the years, it has become common and accepted to include one's credit history among the many factors that a company uses in order to consider and properly price a car insurance policy."
816,Which  Is  The  Best  Classic  Car  Insurance?,"If the health insurance plan is a part of a labor negotiation, terminating the plan would violate the bargaining agreement.

819,How  Much  Life  Insurance  Should  A  Husband  Have?,Medigap is a secondary insurance plan to pick up the financial gaps after Medicare pays their portion. Medigap is a risk management tool. Without a hefty bank account you can have a lot of out of pocket costs if you have a bad year. Two or three hospitalizations (it happens) in a year plus the 20% that Medicare doesn't pay (Part B) can add up quickly. Medigap premiums are a small price to pay in order to sleep well at night.
820,Does  Disability  Insurance  Cover  Alcoholism?,"Theoretically they should be quite accurate. A company can identify you, all the drivers in your household, every moving violation or accident that you have had, the VIN of every vehicle registered to your address and can do the computations quickly and accurately. Will that be best for you, probably not? Price isnt everything. If you dont have adequate limits to protect you when you have a claim then you have made an expensive decision. You might have saved a few dollars but the claim could send you into bankruptcy."
821,Who  Can  Sell  Annuities  In  Tennessee?,"If the household relies on both of you as wage earners, then both of you need life insurance. One major factor to consider is annual salary. You should get at least 3 - 5 times this number. Other things to consider is amount of debt (mortgage, credit, loans etc.), children's college tuition and any attained assets currently owned. All these things among others should be considered when figuring out how much life insurance should be purchased for the wage earner. This is why it is very important to speak to an Agent about purchasing Life Insurance."
822,What  Qualifies  As  A  Qualifying  Events  For  Health  Insurance?,"Disability insurance like most individual morbidity insurance products does not cover pre-existing conditions like alcohol abuse. Motor vehicle records can be used to detect DUIs. One of the urine analysis items covers liver function, which can detect alcohol abuse.

827,Will  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Roof  Damage?,"Most advisers recommend the day you start working full time. Most American workers have 90 days in cash reserves to pay household expenditures.

And while Social security disability is available, its benefits may not be enough, so purchasing individual disability insurance is necessary and part of your defensive financial plan."
828,Where  To  Buy  Individual  Disability  Insurance?,"Health insurance will only cover cosmetic surgery if it's medically necessary. If you're getting an elective cosmetic procedure done, you would be responsible for paying the entire cost of the surgery out-of-pocket. Because surgery is very expensive in general, it's always good to talk to your agent/insurance carrier to see if a procedure would be covered."
829,Can  I  Contribute  To  An  IRA  If  I  Participate  In  A  Retirement  Plan  At  Work?,"If the roof damage is caused by a covered loss, then the roof damage typically would be covered minus your deductible.

Most agents have the means to receive quotes form multiple carries, so they can show you a few different options. Don't just pick the cheapest product. Listen to your agent when she explains the different riders and provisions so you receive the BEST policy, not the most inexpensive."
831,Can  You  Take  A  Loan  From  Life  Insurance?,"Pretax contributions to an employers sponsored defined contribution plan like a 401(k) is an excellent retirement funding option, especially if your employer matches any portion of your contribution, which may include the additional contribution for those over age 50. But if you have more discretionary income you could contribute to a Roth IRA. If your spouse doesn't have a retirement plan at work, an IRA or Roth IRA may also be available for contributions. The issue is the phase out rules on contribution deductions."
832,Why  Does  My  Landlord  Want  Me  To  Get  Renters  Insurance?,"Great question! The death benefit is safe, in nearly all cases, but if you are being pursued by the IRS for some reason, it would be my bet that while they may not be able to seize your money from the payment, they will probably seize whatever asset you put it in. Meaning if you buy a car with the money, and they are busy trying to get money you owe them, I'd expect to see your car disappear eventually. (probably sooner than later) Good luck! Thanks for asking!"
833,Will  Medicare  Pay  For  Any  Dental  Work?,"If the permanent life insurance policy has accumulated cash values you can borrow a majority of the funds available.

If you would like to discuss details of renters insurance coverage, please contact a a local agent to have them go over it with you."
835,How  Soon  Does  Car  Insurance  Start?,"Original Medicare does not pay for dental work that is part of routine care of the teeth, such as exam, cleanings, fluoride treatments, or fillings. It also will not pay for dentures. Some Medicare Supplement plans will cover some dental work. Medicare will cover oral work that done to protect or treat the patient's general health, or to prepare the patient for surgery, radiation, etc that will be performed for a health condition. It will also cover jaw surgery for a broken jaw, or follow up to an infection after an extraction. If the dental patient has a life threatening condition, Medicare may pay for the cost of hospitalization but not the dental work itself."
836,How  To  Choose  The  Best  Auto  Insurance?,"Guaranteed Replacement Cost is a common term that is sometimes misused by agents. It means that, if your home is destroyed, your insurance company will rebuilt it, whatever it costs with no limit. This was a very common settlement option at one time. Insurance companies began offering it to differentiate themselves and soon, almost every company offered it. Today, it's not like that. Some companies will offer it, but only to certain properties. Beware this term when it's thrown around by agents. Some will misuse it to make it seem like they have this when they actually don't. Today, most companies will offer something called ""Extended Replacement Cost"" or other, similar terms. This means that they will replace your home, even if it costs more that the limit on the policy, but they will only go to an extra 10,25, or 50% of the limit. For example, if your home is insured to $100,000, they may pay up to $110,000, $125,000, or $150,000 to rebuild it. Some agents will call this Guaranteed Replacement Cost. Beware, there's nothing guaranteed about it. The bottom line is this: Be smart, get an agent you can trust that's more worried about covering you correctly than just getting a new commission."
837,Who  Sells  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"Car insurance can start very quickly. Typically, when you apply for coverage, you provide information regarding yourself and the vehicle that you will be driving. Other family member driving information may need to be provided. An underwriter quickly reviews the information and it's not unusual to be approved the same day...and sometimes, almost immediately."
838,Does  Medicare  Cover  HIV  Drugs?,I would suggest finding yourself a local agent that you are comfortable working with. This person will typically be your first and last point of contact should you have any concerns about your coverage or claims. They will be the person that will help you purchase the coverages that you need to protect you and your family.
839,What  Is  Considered  A  Lapse  In  Health  Insurance?,"There is a small inventory of long term care insurance companies left in the market place. While there are other companies these appear to be the real players in Long term care insurance: Mutual of Omaha, John Hancock, Med America,Trans america and Genworth. keep in mind that some long term care insurance riders are attached to life and annuity contracts as a supplement to elder care for seniors."
840,What  Information  Do  I  Need  To  Get  Car  Insurance?,Surprised no one has answered this question. YES!!!

842,Is  It  Cheaper  To  Buy  My  Own  Health  Insurance?,"To get car insurance you would need at minimum you would need the vehicle identification numbers of all vehicles that you are getting coverage for, the drivers license numbers of all personsto be covered, the dates of birth of all persons to be covered, address of persons to be covered, garaging address of vehicles, and other personal information of parties to be covered along with required payment by carrier."
843,Is  Refraction  Covered  By  Medicare?,"Their are money good companies. I prefer to go with the big one such as united health care and sponsor of AARP. Cigna Insurance, Humana. You must check their ratings and also their claim processing procedure. free advice.com rates many of the Medigap companies. Rating the claim speed for its customers."
844,How  Good  Is  Global  Life  Insurance?,There may be some exceptions. Carriers generally charge the same rate whether you use an agent to purchase your insurance or buy direct. The agent sales model has evolved over time and commission rates have been reduced as more people use the online model. But at this time there is not a cost savings to buying direct. The same holds true for Life Insurance. Using an agent provides you with advice and makes shopping multiple companies easier.
845,Can  I  Buy  Health  Insurance  With  A  Pre-Existing  Condition?,"No, unfortunately, refraction is not covered by Medicare. Refraction, or the part of the eye exam in which you look at a chart of letters while looking into a machine called a phoroptor, is usually used to determine the need for eyeglasses. Medicare considers this a routine procedure and therefore does not cover it, even though at times refraction is used for medical purposes."
846,How  Much  Does  Renters  Insurance  Cost  In  Massachusetts?,"They are best know for guaranteed issue policies I believe. These would be for very small face amounts, with no medical exam.

850,How  Good  Are  Fixed  Annuities?,"That is a great question! The simple fact is that you can sue anybody, or any company.

Thanks for asking!"
851,Can  Life  Insurance  Be  Taken  By  Creditors?,"It depends upon the source of the water damage, the type of policy you have and whether the house is abandoned.

857,Can  I  Drive  My  Parents  Car  With  Their  Insurance?,"Tax deferred annuities have inherent financial value to those who are suitable to purchase the product. Any savings or investment vehicle can be misrepresented or misplaced in a financial plan. But that's a problem with the adviser, not the product. For those in high tax brackets or just someone who wants more than the banks are offering, annuities can make a real contribution to a retirement plan."
858,How  Do  You  Buy  Annuities?,"Renters insurance in Iowa is a tremendous value for the coverage you get. While policies from different insurance companies vary slightly, the basic coverages are very similar. The primary coverage pays for damage/loss to your personal property and pays for injury or damage you cause to others or their property. To start, you need to add up the cost to replace all of your personal property (clothes, furniture, wall hangings, books, CDs, personal records, etc.) and that is the amount of insurance you need to purchase. In most cases, the personal property items are covered while inside your rented unit and while with you away, however there may be some limitations to coverage while away from your unit. You'll have to look at specific policies to know that. Liability coverage is very important because it pays if you are found to have injured or damaged other people or property, unless that injury or damage was caused by a motor vehicle, in which case your auto policy handles it. Liability coverage under the Renters policy protects you if someone gets hurt in/on your rented property, but also from damage you cause while out and about. A common example is you hit someone with an errant tee shot while playing golf. One thing to remember is that you want to make sure you get your personal property covered for replacement cost. If you don't you won't get much for property that is over a couple years old."
859,Can  I  Qualify  For  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"Sure you can. But there may be coverage issues for you and/or your parents. If you live with your folks and the insurance company does not know you are a household driver, they could deny coverage to you and/or your parents for that omission if there is a claim. If you do not live with them, most insurance companies will cover you as a permissive driver. But the operative word there is ""most."" This is a good question we often get from out clients BEFORE the situation occurs to avoid any potential problem. I suggest your call yours or your folks' insurance professional for clarification."
860,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  A  Burst  Pipe?,"Annuities require an application. In the application you must clearly identify yourself, the proposed annuitant and a beneficiary and perhaps a contingent beneficiary. You must identify the source of the money and your experience as an investor. If the annuity is being used in an existing plan, such as a school sponsored 403(b), the details of that plan must be included."
861,How  Does  A  401K  Work  If  You  Quit?,You have to pass the medical requirements and have the financial where withal to pay the premiums. The long term care insurance company will require your medical records from your attending physician and a depending upon your age a paramed exam that may include a blood and urine analysis.
862,Can  I  Get  Life  Insurance  If  I  Have  Lupus?,If the burst pipe was caused by a maintenance issuethere is a good possibility that a claim would not be covered by your homeonwers policy and even if the claim is covered you may still be subject to the policy's deductible. When you own a home maintenance of that home is something that can be quite challenging but needs to be done in order to prevent non-covered incidents from occuring.
863,Can  Annuities  Lose  Money?,"The 401(k) is governed by a document drawn for the employer. Most plans offer a variety of distributions when you terminate, but they are not required to do so. Exercising these options can be quite important. Generally you would want to maintain the character of the funds. If they are tax deferred funds you would want them rolled into a standard IRA. If your income tax is going to be low you can consider rolling it into a Roth IRA and pay the tax for the withdrawal as though it were ordinary income, which is often an alternative."
864,How  Is  Life  Insurance  An  Asset?,"Almost all people with lupus are able to get some type of life insurance policy. Mild, well controlled, systemic lupus alone should not keep you from getting any amount for which you are financially qualified. If you have had recent flare ups, are on steroids, or have complications from your lupus, you may need to take a nonmed policy. There are some no exam policies that do not ask about lupus, and that have reasonable rates. Contact a good impaired risk life insurance agent that carries lots of choices for those with health conditions, and you should be able to get affordable life insurance while having lupus."
865,Will  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Water  Damage  From  A  Roof  Leak?,"That is an excellent question! While your agent may be quick to assure you otherwise, it is possible to lose money on an annuity, but it's awfully tough to do. If you've done your homework, and had a good agent, you will almost always come out ahead. You can lose money if: Your guaranteed interest rate is lower than the cost of inflation, and the cost of the fees on the annuity are unreasonably high; if you have a variable annuity without guarantees, and the market tanks like it did in 2008; and if the money that you invested in the annuity could have brought you a higher rate of return had it been invested elsewhere. If you've done your homework and made sure that your annuity covered these bases, you should find yourself sitting on a healthy income stream for many years to come. I hope that helps, thanks for asking!"
866,When  Can  I  Switch  From  Medicare  Advantage  To  Medigap?,"Cash surrender value of the policy is the asset value of a life insurance contract. As property, life insurance has value and is liquid. If the policy owner decides to ""cash in"" the policy, the insurance company will pay the cash surrender value to the owner within a week or two."
867,What  Is  The  Penalty  For  Cashing  Out  A  Life  Insurance  Policy?,"Homeowners insurance will cover water damage from a roof leak if the roof sustained damage from a recent storm and the damage to the roof resulted in damage inside the home. If the roof has issues that have gone unrepaired, water damage in this circumstance would not be covered. The roof damage and the water damage must have occured at the same time.

868,How  Much  Does  High  Deductible  Health  Insurance  Cost?,"If you have a Medicare Advantage Plan you can switch to a Medigap Plan during AEP (Annual Election Period). Unless you are in a Guaranteed Issue situation, you will have to medically qualify for a Medigap Plan. There are other times during the year that you can switch from a Medicare Advantage Plan to Medigap. If you have Guaranteed Issue Rights, you can purchase a Medigap Plan in your state during your Guaranteed Issue period. Some Guaranteed Issue situations include: 1. Your Medicare Advantage Plan is leaving Medicare or stops giving care in your area. 2. You move out of your Plan's service area. 3. You joined a MA / MAPD when your were first eligible for Medicare Part A at 65 and within the first year of joining, you decide to switch back to Original Medicare. 4. You dropped a Medigap Policy to join a MA / MAPD for the first time. You've been in the Plan less than a year and you want to switch back. 5. You leave a MA / MAPD because the company hasn't' followed the rules -- or misled you. MA = (Medicare Advantage) MAPD = (Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug) Thank you for reading my response."
869,Can  I  Deduct  Premiums  For  Long  Term  Care  Insurance?,"The Penalty for Cashing out a Life Insurance Policy could be the policy surrender charge which can be punitive in the early years of the contract. If the life insurance policy has cash value gain, then an ordinary income tax event will ensue, including any constructive receipt of policy loans or internal policy loans. And if the policy is a Modified Endowment Contract that is cashed in or surrendered or lapsed and the policy owner is under 59 1/2, an additional penalty will be added as well. Consult with your tax adviser before moving forward with any withdrawals, surrenders or policy loans."
870,Should  I  Do  Long  Term  Disability  Insurance?,"High deductible health insurance plans (often referred to as ""HSAs), are one of the cheapest types of medical policies available to individuals and families. They are offered in every state by most of the largest insurers. Rates can vary between $40 and $500 per month, depending on your age, where you live and the deductible and co-insurance you select. If you qualify for a federal subsidy under Obamacare, your premium will substantially reduce."
871,What  Affects  Homeowners  Insurance  Rates?,"If you own a Tax Qualified (TQ) Long Term Care Insurance policy, the premiums can be deducted up to a certain limit. The instructions provided with your tax return will show the amount of premiums that can be deducted at each age."
872,Does  Home  Insurance  Cover  A  Leaking  Roof?,"If you have to choose between buying short or long term disability insurance, most people select long term disability insurance. That is because most people can survive a few months of not having an income, but it is difficult for most people to go without their paycheck for many months or years. If you are trying to decide whether to buy any disability insurance at all, it depends on your income (whether your family depends on it), your health and occupation (whether you qualify for a policy), and the cost of the policy (whether you can afford it). If you are living on minimum wage, buying long term disability insurance is not going to fit in your budget. If you are the breadwinner in your family, don't have a large amount of savings, and have a moderate to good standard of living, it is almost essential to do long term disability insurance."
873,How  Many  Years  Of  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Do  I  Need?,"Many factors affect the premium for your homeowners insurance coverage. Some these factors are: geographic location, reconstruction valuation of the home, number and dollar amount of homeowners claims that you have experience over the last five years, distance to the nearest fire department, distance to nearest fire hydrant, and many more."
874,How  Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Escrow  Work?,"It is always best to talk to your Insurance Professional about the specific terms and conditions of your policy. In general, a Homeowners policy will help you with damage that is caused by a ""covered peril"" as they are listed in your policy documents. There may be situations where the water damage to your interior walls but the repair of your roof may not be included. In general, Insurance does not pay for damage that is an ultimate result of wear and tear or neglect so it is always a good idea to look over your property as each season changes to see if anything needs attention."
875,How  Are  Life  Insurance  Proceeds  Taxed  At  Death?,"You can request the maximum coverage which may differ from company to company and sometimes by state because the price for assisted living and nursing home confinement costs differ. In Arizona my long term care insurance policy pays 7,000 a month for a total benefit of $420,000 or 60 months of coverage."
876,How  Does  Private  Disability  Insurance  Affect  Social  Security  Disability?,"An escrow account is usually setup for you when you buy a new home, and this account is used to pay your property taxes and your homeowners insurance. Your monthly payment will include our principal and interest payment to the mortgage lender, as well as 1/12 of your yearly property taxes and homeowners insurance. When payment is due, your lender will make the payment on your behalf from the escrow account."
877,Who  Provides  Disability  Insurance?,"Life insurance proceeds are exempt from income tax. If there is a part of the life insurance policy that is income earned beyond the death benefit (such as dividends or interest), that will usually be taxable. Also, if the policy is a MEC (modified endowment contract), income tax would be paid. If the proceeds are large enough to warrant estate taxes, federal estate taxed may need to be paid, depending on how the policy was set up."
878,Does  Medicare  Part  B  Cover  Lab  Work?,"You can get up to a total of 80% of your income through a combination of private Disability Insurance and Social Security Disability benefits. If the amount that you are due exceeds 80%, part of the Social Security benefit will be subtracted from the private Disability benefit, or part of the private Disability benefit will be subtracted from the Social Security Disability benefit, so that the total you receive is 80% of your original wages."
879,What  Are  The  Best  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Companies?,"Disability Insurance is provided by Life Insurance agents. The same companies that sell Life Insurance may sell Disability Insurance, and vice versa. Some Life Insurance agents specialize in both. That is the type of agent you want to seek out, as there are a lot of unique features to Disability Insurance that need a knowledgeable agent to explain them in understandable language, and to know how to guide you to pick out an affordable Disability Insurance policy with the features you need."
880,Is  Profit  Sharing  A  Retirement  Plan?,"Medicare Part B covers virtually all outpatient expenses including doctor visits, X-ray, MRI, CT, outpatient surgery, ER, ambulance and lab work. Part B has an annual deductible of $147 (for 2013) and then Medicare pays 80% of approved charges, you pay the remaining balance. If you have a Medigap plan your liability may be $0 if you have plan F"
881,How  Much  Does  Medicare  Cost  A  Year?,"There are many long-term care insurance companies that have affordable rates and top-notch coverage. Some of them include John Hancock, Genworth and Mass Mutual. Since rates and benefits can vary, it is always best to work with an experiernced full-timebroker or financial planner that cab shop the best carriers and discuss the suitability of plans and how they will meet your goals."

If you have at least 10 years of covered Social Security wages, have lived in the US for at least 5 years and are age 65 or older Part A is available at no charge to you. Most will pay $105 per month for Medicare Part B."
884,How  Much  Will  Car  Insurance  Cost  For  A  19  Year  Old?,"Renters Insurance, or what I would refer to as a Tenant-homeowner's policy, would cover any personal property you own except that which is specifically listed as ""Property not covered"". Some of the specific types of property not covered include autos, aircraft, animals, birds and fish. Since cell phones are not on that list, they would be covered property. Specific limits apply to certain types of property, money, theft of jewelry or silver, etc. Cell phones are not on that list either. While a cell phone may be ""covered property"", the damage it sustains must be caused by one of the covered perils. The perils are listed and include fire, lightning, wind, hail, theft, vehicle damage, etc. You will note water damage is not a covered peril, nor is dropping the phone or breaking the screen. These policies have, in addition, a number of exclusions including earthquake, flood, intentional damage, etc. So cell phones would be covered as long as they were damaged by a covered peril and the damage exceeded the deductible which is commonly $250 or more. If you meet all those tests, the basic policy would then reimburse you for the actual value of the phone, not what it costs to replace it. Optional replacement cost coverage is generally available, if you have it the cost of a new phone would be the basis for your claim. Then the question will be what is the value of the phone? Is it the actual phone or the two year service agreement you have committed yourself to? Bottom line, I wouldn't depend on Renter's Insurance to cover damage to my cell phone. It seems to me one of those non-catastrophic risks you may be better off assuming."
885,Can  Long-Term  Care  Insurance  Be  Fixed?,"The qualifications for Medicare in Washington are, first of all, to have paid into Medicare for at least 40 quarters, or be the spouse of someone who did. Most people either get Medicare when they turn age 65, or when they have been on Social Security Disability for two years. There are other situations where someone can get Medicare in Washington, but those are the most common qualifications."
886,What  Is  A  Deductible  For  Health  Insurance?,"Car insurance rates on a 19 year-old will vary, depending on where you live, your driving record, the type of car you own and your coverage. It could be quite cheap or fairly expensive, if there are multiple violations. As an experienced broker, our job is to shop all of the top companies for customers and utilize our websites to research and compare the best choices."
887,What  Is  Auto  Insurance  Stacking?,"There is no need to ""fix"" long-term care insurance because it is not broken. However, our current system of how we as a societyassist the growing number of elderly who may have no one to take care of them is in need of serious repair. Right now, if one cannot afford the cost of long-term care, they must become ""indigent"", that is to say, have less that about $2,000 in liquid assets and make less than $35/mo.(those numbers are adjusted annually and may not be accurate).Assets excluded from the equation are one's house, one's car, and approximately $91,000 in savings or checking for spousal support. If you have more than that you have to ""spend down"" in order to qualify for government assistance (Medicaid - in CA, Medical). The problem is thatthose programs are not well-funded and may not have sufficient funds when the current baby-boomer demographic hits the age when many will need expensive long-term care. The private sector provides a solution to this problem in selling long-term care insurance to the general public. However, while highly valuable, it is also highly priced. In fact, the middle class, for which it was originally designed to help, have been priced out of the market. Agents are challenged to come up with coverage that middle class folk can afford. The state and federal government's solution is Medicaid. However, without reform, Medicaid - a partnership between the federal government and the states - will likely run out of money within the next 10-15 years. No one wants that to happen, but no one is doing anything about it right now. A congressional commission has been meeting since the beginning of summer 2013 on the matter of long-term care and should be coming out soon with recommendations for confronting the problem of how we help our elderly die with dignity."
888,Does  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Subletters?,"A deductible is the amount of money you must pay before your health insurance benefits begin paying for services that are subject to the deductible. For example, if your deductible is $2,000, you're required to pay the $2,000 deductible for services before the plan benefits ""kick in."" The deductible may not apply to all services though - some services, for example, may only require a copay or coinsurance amount, varying from plan-to-plan."
889,Is  travel  insurance  worth  the  money?,"Stacking is where you take the limits of your uninsured motorist coverage and stack them up. For example you carry 50/100 uninsured motorist limits and are hit by an uninsured motorist and are injured. Your policy would pay up to 50,000 for the injury of each person in your auto up to 100,000 max. Now lets say for example you have two cars on your policy. Of course each car has the same 50/100 limits. With stacking since yourpolicywas covering two cars the limits would be stacked and your now have 100/200 coverage in any auto accident. Stacking is not available in all states and for those states that offer stacking it comes with a premium."
890,Is  Wet  Rot  Covered  By  Home  Insurance?,More than likely not. Insurance policy's are written for a specific person (and ther immediate family member living in the same residence). Transfering a coverage from one insured to another is virtually impossible and have the policy premium be proper for the risk that the carrier assumes for the risk.
891,How  Much  Is  Car  Insurance  In  MA?,"To determine the value of a travel insurance policy review the coverage that you currently have. Some people have coverage that extends to the locality where they live, or the state in which they reside. Coverage outside of that specified area can be highly limited. The issue becomes more severe with most plans when you travel overseas. If your current coverage is inadequate to cover potential difficulties secure a travel insurance policy. Personally, I travel overseas frequently and never purchase travel insurance."
892,Can  Car  Insurance  Be  In  Your  Parent's  Name?,"In general, no, home insurance will not cover wet rot. A homeowners policy is there to protect you from the sudden and accidental, not the ongoing. To file a claim, you have to be able to pinpoint what happened and when it happened. Wet rot describes a long time, ongoing circumstance. Your homeowners policy is designed to make you whole after an ""occurrence"". It's not designed to maintain your home. If you have a condition that could, potentially, damage your home, it's the homeowners responsibility to correct that condition to protect your home from future damage. This brings up the question of the cost of your homeowners insurance. Every claim impacts the loss ratio of your company and, ultimately, your rates. Want to control the cost of your homeowners insurance? Take a higher deductible and pay for the smaller things yourself. You'll save money in the long run."
893,Will  Renters  Insurance  Cover  Flood  Damage?,"The only way to find out is to request an actual quote. What I can tell you is that auto insurance will be more expensive in a big city such as Boston than in a less populated area because of the higher likelihood of a claim and the higher cost of repairs in a bigger city. Also, keep in mind that not all insurance is the same and you generally get what you pay for. I highly encourage you to get liability limits higher than the legal minimum in your state. Liability coverage is pretty cheap if you have a good driving record and if you ever have an accident and injure someone you'll be VERY happy you have higher limits."
894,Can  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Premiums  Increase?,"Not sure where you live, but here in CT, Insurance Policies need to be issued in the name (s) of the registered owners of a vehicle. Therefore, if one or both of your parents own the car, the policy would be issued in their name (s) and you would be listed on the policy as a rated driver of that car. If however, you are theregistered owner of the car, then the policy needs to be issued in your name."
895,When  Should  Homeowners  Insurance  Start?,Niether homeowners or renters insurnace will cover flood damage under normal circumstances. To get flood insurance coverage it must be purchased from a carrier that is appointed bye the federal government. Only select carriers provide flood insurance coverage and agents must be appointed with one of those carriers to be able to sell flood insurance coverage.
896,When  Can  I  Buy  A  Medigap  Policy?,"Yes they can. You individually cannot be targeted for a rate increase, but across the board rate increases may occur. To lessen the possibility, do your research and make sure your coverage is placed with a company with a long track record of writing long-term care insurance with minimal rate increase history."
897,When  Does  Health  Insurance  Cover  A  Tummy  Tuck?,Homeowners insurance should start the day that you take ownership of your house. For most people its the closing day on the sale of the home. Homeowners policies renew annually after that. Don't wait until the last minute to get your homeowners insurance setup because it could delay the closing date on the house.
898,What  Does  Aflac  Cancer  Insurance  Pay?,"You should buy your Medigap plan when you're new to Medicare - this is THE BEST time to buy a Medicare supplement plan because you have a 6-month window (your initial open enrollment period - starts from your Medicare Part B effective date) to apply for any Medigap plan with NO medical underwriting. This means that a carrier cannot decline you for coverage for any pre-existing conditions or other medical-related illness. Beyond this window, you'll be subject to answering health questions to qualify for a new plan (every carriers' questions are different) if you don't have a guaranteed-issue right available to you. Anyone over the age of 65 and has Medicare Part A & Part B can buy a Medigap plan. If you're under 65, you can still purchase a Medigap plan if you're on Medicare for disability or ESRD, but the cost will be very high. Medigap plans are designed to be purchased by individuals age 65 and up. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your Medigap coverage, quotes, and comparisons of plans and if you have any other questions. Thanks very much."
899,How  To  Check  Medicare  Eligibility  For  Providers?,"As a general rule, a ""tummy tuck"" is viewed as cosmetic surgery and is not covered by health insurance polices. However,obesity is becoming an increasing problem in our nation.This has resulted in a growing number of people who have reached health or life threatening levels of morbid obesity for which they have had either prescription and/or surgical treatments that result in extreme weight loss. In some cases the weight gain has stretched the person's skin to such an extent that after their extreme weight loss following treatment their skin does not return to normal levels and the person is left with folds of skin which can, in some cases, become sources of medical problems themselves (e.g. - severe rashes and infections). In these extreme circumstances the insurance company may agree that it is an issue of medical necessity that this issue be surgically addressed and the will approve coverage for the removal or lifting of this excess skin tissue. This has been the only circumstance where I have seen an insurance carrier approve what might be construed as a tummy tuck."
900,Does  UMPD  Cover  Damage  To  A  Stolen  Auto  With  Liability  Only  Coverage?,"What does AFLAC'c Cancer policy pay? I can only give you a general idea as each policy pays out different amounts, depending on the level of coverage you purchase. With that said, AFLACs Cancer policies usually pay for: Cancer tests such as Mammographies cervical screening colonoscopies, daily hospital benefit for room and board, some cancer drugs, cancer surgical benefits, anesthesiologist, daily doctor visits while you are in the hospital, blood, plasma, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, reconstruction after surgery, daily visits to the hospital by the patients doctor, benefits for travel to a cancer center including hotel, airfare, gas for your car to get there, ambulance benefits. These are some of the main coverages, but remember that there either annual or lifetime limits as to how much AFLAC will pay, it all depends on your policy."
901,What  Does  Genworth  Long  Term  Care  Insurance  Cover?,"How to check medicare eligibility for providers. The first thing you need is medicare part a & part b. If you have that than you have a choice to stay with original medicare or you can choose a medicare advantage plan. You can choose any provider you want to with part a & b, however the most important thing you want to look out for when choosing a plan is if your doctor and hospital is in the network. Than you want to look at if your medication is covered."
902,What  Is  The  Definition  Of  Disability  Insurance?,UMPD covers damage to your vehicle if it is in an accident caused by another party hit you and is at fault. Unfortunately UMPD does not cover the theft of a vehicle. You would of had to carry comprehensive coverage to cover the theft of your vehicle
903,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Electrical  Surges?,Genworth is a leading manufacturer and distributor of long term care insurance. Their long term care policies cover various options of elderly care from assisted living at home to nursing home confinement. The contract offers additional riders like the inflation rider that can mitigate rise in the cost of living.
904,Does  Critical  Illness  Insurance  Cover  Arthritis?,"Every disability insurance policy has differing definitions and communicates its contractual language in complex clauses or policy provisions. That being said, a general definition is any prolonged illness and/or injury that incapacitates you in your ability to work verifies by a physician constitutes a disability event. Again, make sure you read the policy provisions and have a good understanding before moving forward with your purchase."
905,How  Do  Entrepreneurs  Get  Health  Insurance?,"For the most part a very common cause of power surge is a lightening strike and this is a covered peril in most standard issue Homeowners' contracts. Sometimes, if power is lost as a result of a storm, when the service is restored there might be a surge and this too would be covered as it is a result of the storm damage."
906,Which  Disability  Insurance  Is  Best?,"Critical Illness Insurance pays a lump sum to someone who is diagnosed with a life threatening illness that has a major impact on their lives. Arthritis generally does not fall into this category, and I am not aware of that condition being list in a critical illness list of covered conditions."
907,Is  Medicare  Used  Effectively  To  Assist  Americans?,"An entrepreneur is often self-employed and carries private health insurance coverage. Typically, they have an HSA or high-deductible plan, although it is not required. An experienced broker can easily assist an entrepreneur with purchasing affordable health care. We know and understand the mostimportantneeds and how to shop for the best plan. If there are family members involves, a comprehensive plan may be the most appropriate."
908,What  Is  A  Child  Rider  On  Term  Life  Insurance?,"To find which Disability Insurance is best for you, you need to visit with an agent who understands this product and can shop several companies to find your best rate. Your agent can also help you figure out which features to include on your policy so that it accomplishes the purposes for which it is intended."
909,What  Is  The  Number  One  Life  Insurance  Company?,"Medicare has two options: 1. origninal medicare & 2. Medicare advantage. Original medicare is administered by the same beaurcrats that Obama has used to trash the health care system whereas Medicare Advantage is administered by PRIVATE insurance companies. Medicare Advantage has proven to be the most cost effective system of rendering medicare services because the insurance companies know what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. Medicare on the other hand continues to be riddled with Waste, Fraud, & Abuse-which can be summaraized by spelling P O L I T IC I A N S always looking for an opportunity to buy votes. As a matter of fact one of the L I E S CMS(Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services) has put in the Medicare Advantage booklets is ""every Medicare Advantage plan has to be the equivalent of ""original Medicare"". Really? I will promise you original medicare covers 80% of LAB work, especially when it is done for annual physical. Yet, when a particular Medicare Advantage Plan refused to pay my lab charges it was an exercise in futility to get CMS to correct the problem. The Bureaucrats created two classes of sales people when Medicare Advantage was created and adminstered by the wonderful beaucrats- one class that is completely unregulated when they sell Medicare Supplement and the sales person that sells Medicare Advantage is CONTROLLED by the beaurcrats and this last year when I completed the REQUIRED CERTIFICATION it took me 24 hous just to complete the certification. Compare that to the fact I read and took the test and passed the test to sell Obummer Care in less than three hours. Controlling Health Insurance is all about CONTROLLING YOU-THE CONSUMER. Did you realize Medicare is controlled by a UNION IN wASHINGTON D. C. If you want effective health insurance you will identify the members of the unions and you will vote for politicians that will put the unions out of business."
910,What  Does  A  Retirement  Plan  Do?,"A child rider on Term life insurance adds life insurance to your policy that will cover your child(ren). It is usually available to children age 15 days to approx age 17 (the age varies by company). You select a face amount of the child rider, usually between $5,000 and $25,000. This that would pay if a tragedy occurred in your family, and you lost one or more of your children. The child rider benefit would pay that entire amount for each deceased child. The rider pays for death by any reason, just as your policy does, with the exception of suicide in first two years, or if your child had a serious health condition that was not disclosed on the application and death occurred during the first two years of purchasing the rider. If your child has type 1 diabetes, intellectual disability, or other maladies, unfortunately, they will not be able to be on the rider.Therefore, it is good to get the rider while your first child is young; then the rest are automatically added. While few children pass away, the real value of a child rider can come when your child turns approx 25 (again, the age varies by company). At that time the child rider can usually be changed to a permanent life insurance policy of about 5 times the face amount of the child rider. They do not ask any health questions, so if your child developed an illness after being put on the rider, it will not matter. They will then have a reasonably priced life insurance policy for the rest of their lives."
911,Does  Grange  Auto  Insurance  Cover  Rental  Cars?,MetLife and its related companies have the most assets and life insurance in force than any other U.S. Company. John Hancock has the best five year net investment yield of U.S. carriers.There are life insurance companies who are the number one in several critical balance sheet items.
912,Can  You  Buy  Life  Insurance  Online  With  No  Exam?,"A good retirement plan is a financial strategy that should address income and long term care needs based on life expectancy. Establishing a milestone event like retirement can be daunting when youre young and life expectancy could extend beyond our understanding or the mere fact that Social Security may not even exist as we know it. But for baby boomers, retirement is a looming certainty. Most baby boomers will outlive previous perhaps by a decade (living to age 90) and most are planning on working until age 70 to contribute another five years to their retirement fund, maximize their income from Social Security and forced distributions from their qualified plans."
913,What  To  Do  When  Home  Insurance  Drops  You?,It depends on your policy and the circumstances. Rental is something you can add to your auto policy. It is designed to provide you with a rental car if you are involved in an at fault accident. If the accident is the fault of the other driver then generally his insurance would cover the rental. Keep in mind insurance laws differ in many states. Some states are what is called no-fault. This means that neither driver is considered at fault in the event of an accident and each drivers insurance would pay for their own insured. Check with you agent to make sure of the laws in your state.
914,Will  Medicare  Pay  For  Blood  Transfusions?,"Yes, you can. However, the no exam aspect only applies to the blood and urine tests. Insurance carriers still look at your medical history. When applying for a life policy insurers tend to look at two aspects health wise. They review your medical history as far back as a decade through both your doctor (chart notes) and the Medical Information Bureau (think of it as similar to a credit report.). They also take blood and urine samples (possibly an ECG as well) to get a ""snapshot"" of the day the examiner visited. This level of information allows a more complete risk review when pricing a policy. The rule of thumb is the more questions asked the lower the cost of the policy. The fewer questions asked the more expensive. So a no exam company will probably have greater premiums charged than a full exam company for the same person. Sometimes this is a considerable amount of money paid out to skip the exam."
915,Who  Is  Exempt  From  Buying  Health  Insurance?,"Insurers dont usually drop a customer for no reason. Claim activity and payment issues may often result in a termination notice but there can be a number of other reasons. If you have other insurance with that company or agent, I might try to appeal that decision. There may be a reasonable explanation for adverse claim experience or money problems. If you can assure the company or agent an unfavorable pattern most likely will not continue, they may reverse their position and continue providing coverage. Assuming larger deductibles or paying premiums up front with a credit card may also work in your favor. If that doesnt work, independent agents usually represent more than one other company. They may be able to simply place your coverage with another company but make sure you pay close attention to the questions on a new companys application. I suggest it is normally a good idea to combine your insurance with one company or agent when possible. That may make you more important to them than if you only have a single policy. Premium leverage can often work to your advantage. Although I hesitate to use them, a number of insurers claim to specialize in replacing cancelled insurance. Often they charge more, may limit the scope of coverage and be more difficult to work with should a claim occur. Proceed with care in this direction. Many states offer assigned risk pools or similar facilities that accept insurance from residents who are unable to obtain insurance through normal channels. In certain situations these alternatives may be worth considering. I would not consider this alternative a long-term solution. If this becomes your only viable alternative, make an effort to reenter the standard insurance marketplace as soon as you can."
916,How  Much  Is  Medicare  Part  B  Copay?,"Medicare Part A will pay for blood transfusions given in a hospital or skilled nursing facility setting. Medicare Part B will pay for blood transfusions given to outpatients. However, neither pays for the first three pints within a calendar year. If you have Medicare Advantage, contact your plan to see if it provides additional coverage for blood transfusions."
917,What  Are  The  Benefits  Of  Critical  Illness  Insurance?,"Individuals who qualify for their states Medicaid program, and those who are covered by a family members policy. Medicaid is a federal program that is managed and implemented on the state level, it has been traditionally provided to low-income individuals who fall below the poverty line. However it looks as though it will be expanded by PPACA to include those who fall below 200% of the Federal Poverty Line (however there is quite a bit of time between current guidelines and January 1st. 2015). The only other way that you can be exempt is if you are listed as a dependent on someone elses policy."
918,Can  I  Open  A  Car  Insurance  Company?,"There are two main expenses you're responsible for in Medicare Part B - the monthly premium ($104.90 for those with incomes of $85,000 or less, or $170,000 or less for those married filing jointly on their tax returns. The premium is higher if you're above these income levels) and the deductible. I believe you're referring to the Medicare Part B deductible. The deductible for 2014 is $147 (no change from 2013). Original Medicare (Parts A & B) takes care of approximately 80% of the cost for your healthcare. A medicare supplement is great to add to Original Medicare for those on a fixed income as it can help take care of the other 20% and create a much more predictable expense structure for your healthcare."
919,Is  Life  Insurance  Essential?,"Look at the people you know. How many people do you know who have had a stroke, heart attack, or other critical illness that will affect them the rest of their lives. Critical illness coverage provides funds to pay for deductibles and copays, cost of medication, helps with rehab costs, and helps provide for lost income. If you had a heart attack and couldn't work how long would you be able to meet your expenses?"
920,Why  Is  Life  Insurance  A  Unilateral  Contract?,"Check with your state insurance commissioner for guidance in establishing a car insurance company. There will be capital requirements that might stop you from the venture. You may find that laws are more favorable in another state for establishing an insurance company; however, you still must meet the requirements in the state where you want to operate."
921,What  Are  Medicare  Lifetime  Reserve  Days?,"Only you can answer this question of Life Insurance being essential. For those of us who see the financial loss in families who lost a parent or spouse, Life Insurance relieves financial stress allowing you to take care of what is most important, your family. YES, I believe life insurance is essential. Life Insurance provides you or rather your beneficiary with monies otherwise would not be available.

What will happen financially and how would you relieve that financial stress."

923,What  Is  The  Best  Medigap  Insurance?,"Under Medicare part A you will have a deductible for the first 60 days, a copay for next 60 days. After that you enter your lifetime reserve during which your Medicare cover is extended to a maximum of an additional 60 days during your lifetime at an even higher daily copay. Most people never use their lifetime reserve days but it does happen. After your lifetime reserve days are used you are responsible for 100% of the costs."
924,What  Is  Adjudication  In  Health  Insurance?,Renters insurance does not cover damage to vehicles. The vehicles insurance would cover what ever damage occurred. There is a slight possibility renters insurance would cover damage to a vehicle if for example you threw a baseball through the glass but even this on is a maybe. The vehicles comprehensive coverage would pick up this kind of damage.
925,Is  Life  Insurance  Considered  An  Asset  For  Medicaid?,In my opinion the best Medigap insurance plan is the one that delivers the most value for the premium charged. Usually it is any plan OTHER THAN Medigap plan F. Medigap Plan F is the most expensive (and most popular) but it also pays the highest commission to the agent. Most of my clients are satisfied with the premium savings and value they receive from Medigap plan G or plan N. #GeorgiaMedicarePlans
926,How  Much  Disability  Insurance  Do  You  Need?,"Adjudication is a review of submitted claims to determine if you qualify based on your plan and premiums, and if the claim is an eligible claim under the terms of your policy.

To find out the best way to handle your life insurance policy, be sure to know the Medicaid guidelines for your state and contact a knowledgeable agent to assist you."
928,What  Is  The  Best  Life  Insurance  In  Delaware?,"There are guidelines as to how much disability insurance a person can purchase. Generallybetween60 and 80% of earned income. I would purchase the maximum allowable. To keep the premium down you can use longer elimination periods. Determine how long you can function without the income and then purchase a policy that doesn't start until the end of that period. For example, if you have enough liquid savings to pay 30 days of bills, then select a 30 day elimination period. An elimination period acts as adeductible."
929,Can  Auto  Insurance  Companies  Drop  You?,"It can vary a lot from one person to the next, and even what city and state you live in. In my area of the country (the mid-west) I would save an average person spends from $60 - $150 / month for full coverage car insurance. Your credit will play a role in your rate as well as your driving record and even what other drivers might have access to your car."
930,What  Is  Covered  Under  Medigap?,"The best life insurance in Delaware will be a plan that fits your age, health and needs. Some companies specialize in wonderful Whole Life insurance, but their Term policies are not competitive. Some offer outstanding Term rates, but don't even carry Whole Life.

936,How  Quickly  Is  Life  Insurance  Paid  Out?,"The premium for a renters policy has two basic elements. The first is the property to be covered (amount, and location.) The second is liability. The liability section could be the most critical as it protects you from the greatest threat, lawsuit. Inventory your personal property and insure for the cost of replacing that. Determine how much liability insurance you need. Your agent should be a great help here. You will probably be pleasantly surprised by the cost of the policy."
937,Who  Must  Purchase  Health  Insurance?,"Most student health insurance plans are quite limited in scope. They normally provide benefits limited to the student health center on campus but may also include benefits for a hospital that is near the campus. These plans usually do not cover pre-existing conditions, or if there is pre-existing coverage there is a long waiting period. Student health insurance plans typically track the school year and terminate in the summer when the school year ends. There are no carry over or runoff benefits."
938,Is  Disability  Insurance  A  Good  Idea?,"How quickly life insurance is paid out depends on the company and if all the ""ducks are in a row"". If the company has changed hands, the address of the beneficiary has changed, etc, it may take a couple months to submit and receive the claim. If everything is up to date and the processing time of that company is fast, it may take less than a week."
939,Does  Home  Insurance  Increase  With  A  Pool?,"Under the Affordable Care Act, everyone will have to have health insurance or pay a penalty (also known as an ""individual shared responsibility payment""). If you choose to pay the penalty instead of securing coverage, you will still be responsible for 100% of your medical care. The penalty is calculated in one of 2 ways (you pay whichever is the higher amount). In 2014, the penalties will be calculated as: 1) 1% of your yearly household income featuring a maximum penalty as the national average yearly premium for a bronze plan. 2) $95 per person for the year (If under age 18, then $47.50) featuring a maximum penalty per family of $285 under this method. Its important to note that the penalty will change each year. In 2015, method one increases to 2% of your yearly household income and method two increases to $325 per person. In 2016, it will increase again to 2.5% for method one and $695 per person for method two. The penalty methods will be adjusted for inflation in later years. To avoid the penalty, you need to have health insurance that qualifies as minimum essential coverage. Please feel free to contact me for help. Thanks very much."
940,What  Is  The  Primary  Purpose  Of  An  Irrevocable  Life  Insurance  Trust?,"Disability Insurance is a good idea for most people. Of course, there are those who simply cannot afford it. But for those who can, it is one of the most prudent insurance policies to get. That is because a disability can happen to anyone of any age, and it can happen more than one time. Being disabled can wreak havoc on a family due to the resultant loss of income. Disability insurance helps keep the tragedy manageable."
941,How  Much  Does  A  Urinalysis  Cost  Without  Health  Insurance?,"Yes it does. There is the added exposure of someone falling into your pool and drowning or being injured, which could reult in a lawsuit against you. The liability coverages in your homeowners policy would provide you with coverage for attorneys expenses to defend you and a possible payout, up to the liability limit in your homeowners policy."
942,Can  I  Get  Insurance  On  A  Car  That  Does  Not  Belong  To  Me?,Life Insurance Trusts allow Insurance proceeds to go into a trust and allocated where the person who controls the trust sees fit. It is a great way to ensure your wishes are carried out with the proceeds deposited. In an Irrevocable Life Insurance trusts the person who sets it up basically loses the ability to change the trust. It may be used to prevent anyone else from changing the original intention behind why the trust was first set up. It is a great tool to ensure future financial investments/distributions are adhered to. A Life Insurance professional can explain the basics of how insurance fits in and then direct you to a legal professional who can set it up.
943,Does  Wells  Fargo  Offer  Life  Insurance?,"A urinalysis costs approximately $35-$60, depending where you live and what facility is used to conduct the test.

944,Can  There  Be  Too  Much  Choice  In  A  Retirement  Savings  Plan?,"An auto policy covers an automobile, not a driver. If you are not the owner, and dont have any other insurable interest, you cannot be named as the insured on the policy. The information about being a loan holder is important. You named to be named on the policy as a lienholder. If you lease the car to someone else than you also need to be named as the additional insured."
945,Why  Do  I  Need  Medigap?,Some investment brokers from firms like Wells Fargo happen to have a life insurance license so they can offer variable annuities to their clients but they tend to not use it for life insurance. While a few may actively sell life insurance most do not. Access to insurance companies and products may be limited at these firms. Insurance is a complex financial product requiring a planning expertise that most investment brokers do not have. If you need insurance advice I suggest that you seek out the services of a life insurance professional.
946,Does  Life  Insurance  Really  Work?,This is one of the great conundrums of investing and saving for retirement. The menu selection is too big and can't be adequately understood with such an inventory of investment options. The majority of advisers have a difficult time keeping monitoring and track of all the available product lines.
947,What  Does  Whole  Life  Mean  In  Insurance?,"Only you can decide if you need a Medigap plan. Original Medicare will only cover about 80% of your approved Medicare Part A and Part B claims.

951,How  Long  Does  It  Take  For  Life  Insurance  To  Pay?,"The lowest price auto insurance coverage that I am aware of that you can purchase would be liability only coverage.

Some states may also require that you purchase a minimum amount of uninsured and under-insured motorist besides the liability coverages mentioned previously."
952,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Loss  Of  Use?,"That is a great question! It isn't a Federal law, but it is in most States, Counties, and Cities. The damage and expense of uninsured motorists is something no one wants, so it is pretty much everywhere that you will find a law about having insurance if you want to drive. The penalties for driving uninsured are very high, and it is so much more worth it to spend the money on the policy. Please do not consider hitting the road without it. Thanks for asking!"
953,What  Does  Medicare  HIC  Stand  For?,"It takes Life Insurance anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple months to pay, once they have the certified death certificate and completed death claim form. Some companies are faster than others, and if there is a glitch with wrong address or something, that will slow it down. But for the most part, it is just the time it takes for processing and they try very hard not to drag it out."
954,Why  Is  Whole  Life  Insurance  A  Good  Investment?,"Most homeowners policies provide some form of coverage for the ""additional"" costs a family incurs should their home be damaged by a covered loss and not fit for occupancy. I wouldn't call it ""Loss of Use"" but it's fairly close. The coverage limit is usually a separate amount of insurance and is based on a percentage of the amount of insurance you carry on your home, 20% or more is common."
955,Does  Homeowners  Insurance  Cover  Power  Surges?,"Medicare HIC stands for your Medicare Health Insurance Claim number or code.

956,What  Is  Group  Health  Insurance?,"Whether whole life is a good investment or not depends on how you define a good investment. That being said, it can be a good investment when you look at it closely. Life insurance creates cash at death and whole life is designed to be in force when you die, not if you die within a specified term From an estate planning point of view, that is a good thing, If you need insurance coverage, then the tax advantaged growth of a participating whole life policy can be attractive from a wealth accumulation point of view.The funds can, among other things, be used to supplement retirement income. If you have further questions, or feel that I could be of assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

958,When  Can  You  Enroll  In  Health  Insurance?,"Group health insurance is health insurance policies businesses own and offer coverage under the plan to its employees.

Group health insurance quotes are based on the size of your business, the industrys SIC code, age of employees, and average employee health (except in Maryland, which requires no medical underwriting). There are no instant online quotes for group health insurance for these reasons. To get a quote for group coverage, you'll want to contact an experienced health insurance broker because there are a large number of moving parts and details in group plans. Working with an independent broker will allow you to shop for quotes from multiple companies in one place and they can help you review and compare plans to determine which option will be most suitable for your business and its employees.

961,How  Are  Qualified  Annuities  Taxed?,"The majority of landlords require their tenants to have renters insurance with a lease provision. No state law requires renters insurance, aside from a few local laws pertaining to people with certain breeds of dogs who must maintain liability insurance. But it's certainly a good idea to have, because one break-in or fire would devastate you. Renters insurance replaces your property in a matter of days, as opposed to the years you'd have to work to replace one thing at a time as you can afford it."
962,Who  Can  Be  Covered  By  Life  Insurance?,"Deferred annuities are annuities that do not provide immediate income. One places money into these annuities by paying a premium and the that premium becomes cash surrender value in the annuity. The cash value then accumulates at an interest rate specified within the contract. The contract owner will have the option to turn the cash into a guaranteed income stream at a later date, or surrender the annuity for it's accumulated cash value."
963,Can  I  Keep  Insurance  Money  And  Not  Fix  My  Car?,"Qualified Annuities are taxed as ordinary earned income. But they are only taxable upon withdrawal of funds. A ""Qualified"" account means that the funds were contributed on a pre-tax basis. This can be a significant advantage when accumulating assets. But for the IRS to allow this advantage, they require that the full amount be subject to income tax instead of capitol gains taxes. It is also important to know that at age 70 1/2, they require you to start ""Required minimum Distributions"".

You would not be able to cover your neighbor for example or strangers down the street."
965,Why  Do  We  Need  Critical  Illness  Insurance?,"The answer to that depends on whether or not you own your car outright. If you are making payments to purchase or lease your vehicle than an insurance payout will most likely go directly to the repair facility. If you own your vehicle than you have the right to do whatever you wish with the money you receive from the auto insurance payout. That being said, it is strongly recommended to ensure your vehilce is safe to operate (For the benefit of you and yourpassengers as well as others on the road too).

966,When  Did  Mandatory  Auto  Insurance  Start?,"Car insurance will pay for a stolen car as long as you have comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive coverage covers the vehicle for damages not resulting from a collision accident. For example, fire, theft, glass breakage, a tree falls on the car, ect. If you car is stolen the insurance company will determined the blue book value and pay out the blue book value less your deductible.

If you have a Named Non-Owner Insurance policy, the carrier upon request will issue an SR-22 endorsement to the Governing State Department of Motor Vehicles. In the event that the insurance is cancelled, an SR-26 cancellation form is issued and sent to the Governing Department in order to confirm cancellation of the insurance thus cancelling the SR-22. If one does not desire to purchase the insurance and is merely attempting to get a Form SR-22 issued, there is no method to do so without keeping active insurance for the term that the SR-22 is required. The SR-22 is simply a reporting form confirming continuous coverage. Many States now require electronic reporting between insurance carriers and the State Department of Motor Vehicles."

987,How  To  Sell  Life  Insurance  Online?,"It depends on your needs, budget, and preferences. I would recommend consulting with an independent Medigap broker who can work with you on a personal level and help you evaluate your options. If you want to create a very well-controlled, predictable healthcare expense structure where you don't have to worry about receiving massive medical bills, you may want to consider buying a Medigap plan (most likely a Medigap Plan F or Plan G). The premiums for Medigap plans are typically a little higher than a Medicare Advantage plan, but they feature much broader coverage. Medigap plans are guaranteed renewable and are standardized (meaning a given Medigap plan features the same benefits regardless of the carrier you have it through - a plan F from company ABC is the same plan F from company XYZ). They also have no networks, meaning you can go to any doctor you want that accepts Medicare (the vast majority do these days and you can check to see if a doctor in your area does using a physician finder tool on Medicare's website, Medicare.gov). As far as services go, if your doctor accepts Medicare, then they have to accept your Medigap plan as well. I hope the information is helpful - please feel free to contact me for assistance with your Medigap coverage needs, including quotes and plan comparisons, and if you have any other questions.

This will list the actual charge, the medicare approved amount, and the amount owed by the beneficiary. Medicare pays a doctor 80% of the approved amount. For example if your doctor charges $125 for an office visit, Medicare may approve $100. They would pay $80 and you would be responsible for the other $20. In most States doctors may charge up to 15% over the Medicare approved amount. Some States like Ohio, do not allow this excess charge."
